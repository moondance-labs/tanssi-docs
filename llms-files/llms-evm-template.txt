# Baseline EVM Template {: #baseline-evm-template }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Tanssi's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) network template is designed for teams developing their applications on top of EVM smart contracts. It includes all the essential components needed for a full Ethereum-compatible network:

- **EVM** - adds an Ethereum Virtual Machine execution layer for EVM-based smart contract applications
- **Etherum JSON RPC Support** - Tanssi-powered EVM networks are fully [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/){target=\_blank} compliant. Consequently, all Ethereum-based tools like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank}, [Viem](https://viem.sh){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org){target=\_blank}, [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank} and more, work seamlessly out of the box
- **Unified Accounts** - allows Tanssi-powered EVM networks to feature Ethereum-styled ECDSA accounts

## EVM Network Template {: #evm-network-template }

The template already includes the necessary configuration for seamless integration with the Tanssi protocol and the security provider of choice, for example, [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} on Ethereum. Therefore, this template requires no additional changes in the runtime if the application is built on top of the EVM.

This means that this template is ready to be deployed as-is through Tanssi, unlocking many features, such as:

- Utilize Tanssi's [block production as a service](/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/){target=\_blank}
- Get deterministic transaction finality in seconds
- Choose the security provider that best fits your needs. For example, leverage Ethereum-grade security from [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank}
- Build dApps interacting with your network through an [API](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/libraries/polkadot-js-api/){target=\_blank}
- Connect any Ethereum wallet, such as [Metamask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} and Ledger
- Use well-known Ethereum libraries like [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, [Web3.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, [Web3.py](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/){target=\_blank}, and more
- Deploy EVM smart contracts with tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org){target=\_blank}, [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry){target=\_blank}, and more

## Included Modules {: #included-modules }

Besides the modules and configurations that make the Tanssi EVM network template compatible with the Tanssi protocol, it also includes [many modules](/builders/build/templates/overview/#included-modules){target=\_blank} to provide basic functionalities.

To reach full Ethereum compatibility, these specific modules are also included:

- **[EVM](https://docs.rs/pallet-evm/latest/pallet_evm){target=\_blank}** - it adds support for unmodified EVM bytecode execution on a Tanssi-powered network. It uses the Rust-based [SputnikVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm){target=\_blank} as the underlying EVM engine
- **[Ethereum](https://docs.rs/pallet-ethereum/latest/pallet_ethereum){target=\_blank}** - it works alongside the EVM module to provide full emulation for Ethereum block processing. Among many other tasks, it is responsible for creating emulated Ethereum blocks for Ethereum-specific components such as EVM logs

Both modules are part of the [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} project, which is the backbone of Ethereum-compatible Tanssi-powered networks.

# Smart EVM - Whitelist Contract Deployments

## Introduction {: #introduction }

EVM-compatible Tanssi-powered networks benefit from a unique feature: the network governor can define which accounts are authorized to deploy smart contracts, forbidding the action for any other non-whitelisted account.

This feature brings several key benefits that might be a great fit for different use cases or contexts. Some of those benefits are:

- **Enhanced Security** - by restricting deployment to trusted accounts, the risk of deploying malicious or vulnerable smart contracts is reduced
- **Quality Assurance** - known and vetted accounts can be required to follow specific coding standards and undergo thorough testing before deployment
- **Regulatory Compliance** - uses cases that are highly regulated can limit deployment to ensure that smart contracts meet legal and compliance requirements
- **Spam and Abuse Prevention** - prevent bad actors from deploying large numbers of unnecessary or harmful contracts

In this guide, you'll learn how to use the Sudo account to manage the whitelisted accounts that can deploy smart contracts on your network.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

 - An EVM-compatible Tanssi-powered network (Quick Trial or Dedicated) running [runtime 700](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/tag/runtime-700){target=\_blank} or above. Any new network deployment based on the [EVM template](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank} will do
 - Your network's Sudo account connected to your network's Polkadot.js Apps. You can refer to the [Managing Sudo guide](/builders/manage/developer-portal/sudo/#configuring-polkadotjs-apps){target=\_blank} for instructions on injecting your Sudo account into Polkadot.js Apps

If you're unsure what your Tanssi network's Sudo account is, you can find it in your [Tanssi Dashboard](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank} underneath the **Properties** section.

![Locating your Sudo address on apps.tanssi.network](/images/builders/manage/locate-sudo-account.webp)

!!! warning
    It's critical to protect your Sudo account key with the utmost security precautions, as it grants privileged access to your Tanssi network.

## Getting Started {: #getting-started }

To follow the next sections of this guide, head to Polkadot.js Apps for your Tanssi network. The Polkadot.js Apps link for your Tanssi network can be found in your [Tanssi Dashboard](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank} underneath the **Tooling** section.

![Locating your Polkadot.js Apps Link on apps.tanssi.network](/images/builders/manage/developer-portal/smart-contracts-creation-filter/smart-contracts-creation-filter-1.webp)

Once in Polkadot.js Apps, navigate to the **Developer** tab and click on **Sudo**.

!!! note
    If you do not see **Sudo** in this menu, then you have not associated the Sudo account with Polkadot.js Apps. Make sure that your [Sudo account is injected by your wallet and connected to Polkadot.js Apps](/builders/manage/developer-portal/sudo/#configuring-polkadotjs-apps){target=\_blank}.

## Whitelisting Accounts {: #whitelist-accounts }

To define the accounts that will have authorization to deploy smart contracts, [get your Polkadot.js Apps started](#getting-started) and then take the following steps:

1. Select the **parameters** pallet. **setParameter** will be automatically selected in the functions selector and **ContractDeployFilter** in the **keyValue** parameter
2. Two options will be available in the **ContractDeployFilter** selector: **AllowedAddressesToCreate** and **AllowedAddressesToCreateInner**. Select the **AllowedAddressesToCreate** option if you want to whitelist the accounts for smart contract deployments and the latter to whitelist the accounts for indirect  (via a smart contract call) smart contract deployments
3. Toggle the **Include option** switch
4. Select the **Whitelisted** option
5. Insert the whitelisted account
6. If you need to insert more than one account, click on **Add item**
7. Press **Submit Sudo** and confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Whitelisting Accounts](/images/builders/manage/developer-portal/smart-contracts-creation-filter/smart-contracts-creation-filter-2.webp)

These same steps can be repeated at any moment to remove an account from the whitelist or to add new ones.

## Restoring Permissions to Deploy Smart Contracts {: #restoring-permission}

If you previously authorized some accounts to deploy smart contracts and want to allow any account to deploy smart contracts (as long as they can cover regular transaction fees), then [get your Polkadot.js Apps started](#getting-started) and take the following steps:

1. Select the **parameters** pallet. **setParameter** will be automatically selected in the functions selector and **ContractDeployFilter** in the **keyValue** parameter
2. Two options will be available in the **ContractDeployFilter** selector: **AllowedAddressesToCreate** and **AllowedAddressesToCreateInner**. Select the **AllowedAddressesToCreate** option if you want to clear the whitelist for smart contract deployments and the latter to clear the whitelist for indirect  (via a smart contract call) smart contract deployments
3. Toggle the **Include option** switch
4. Select the **All** option
5. Press **Submit Sudo** and confirm the transaction in your wallet

![Clearing the Whitelisted Accounts](/images/builders/manage/developer-portal/smart-contracts-creation-filter/smart-contracts-creation-filter-3.webp)

## Query the Whitelisted Accounts {: #query-whitelisted-accounts }

To get the current configuration containing the whitelisted accounts that can deploy smart contracts, go to Polkadot.js Apps (as explained in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section), navigate to the **Developer** tab, click on **Chain state**, and take the following steps:

1. Select the **parameters** storage
2. Select the **parameters(ContainerChainTemplateFrontierRuntimeParametersKey)** option
3. Make sure that the **Include option** switch is on
4. Make sure that the **ContractDeployFilter** option is selected
5. Two options will be available in the **ContractDeployFilter** selector: **AllowedAddressesToCreate** and **AllowedAddressesToCreateInner**. Select the **AllowedAddressesToCreate** option if you want to query the whitelist for smart contract deployments and the latter to query the whitelist for indirect (via a smart contract call) smart contract deployments
6. Click the **+** button
7. The current configuration will be displayed

2. Select the account you'd like to receive {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} tokens and press **Next**
3. Press **Connect**

![Request tokens](/images/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/demo-2.webp)

!!! note
    {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} tokens have no value. Please don't spam the faucet with unnecessary requests.

Your tokens will be disbursed shortly, and you can verify your {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token balance by looking up your address on the [explorer]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}){target=\_blank}.

## Network Endpoints {: #network-endpoints }

The demo EVM network HTTPS and WSS endpoints are as follows:

=== "HTTPS"

    ```text
    {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
    ```

=== "WSS"

    ```text
    {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }}
    ```

## Block Explorers {: #block-explorers }

For the demo EVM network, you can use any of the following explorers:

- [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc={{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }}){target=\_blank} (Substrate API)
- [Blockscout]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}){target=\_blank} (Ethereum API)
- [Expedition](https://evmexplorer.tanssi-chains.network/?rpcUrl={{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}){target=\_blank} (Ethereum API)

## Chain ID {: #chain-id }

The demo EVM network has a [chain ID](https://chainlist.org/chain/{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}){target=\_blank} of: `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}`, which is `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_hex_id }}` in hex.

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

You can interact with a Tanssi-powered EVM network using standard Ethereum libraries, like [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, [Web3.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}, and [Web3.py](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/){target=\_blank}. To quickly get started, you'll need to create a provider connected to a Tanssi EVM network:

=== "Ethers.js"

    ```js
    import { ethers } from "ethers";

    const providerRPC = {
      evmNetwork: {
        name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
        // Insert your RPC URL here
        rpc: '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}', 
        chainId: {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}, // {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_hex_id }} in hex,
      },
    };
    const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
      providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, 
      {
        chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
        name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
      }
    );
    ```

=== "Web3.js"

    ```js
    const Web3 = require('web3');

    const web3 = new Web3(
      '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}'
    );
    ```

=== "Web3.py"

    ```python
    from web3 import Web3

    web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}')) 
    ```

# Using Foundry to Deploy to Your EVM Network

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry){target=\_blank} is an Ethereum development environment written in Rust that helps developers manage dependencies, compile projects, run tests, deploy contracts, and interact with blockchains from the command line. Foundry can directly interact with the Ethereum API of Tanssi-powered EVM networks, so it can be used to deploy and interact with smart contracts on your Tanssi network.

There are four tools that make up Foundry:  

- **[Forge](https://getfoundry.sh/forge/overview/){target=\_blank}** - compiles, tests, and deploys contracts
- **[Cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview/){target=\_blank}** - a command line interface for interacting with contracts
- **[Anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview/){target=\_blank}** - a local TestNet node for development purposes that can fork preexisting networks
- **[Chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview/){target=\_blank}** - a Solidity REPL for quickly testing Solidity snippets

This guide will cover how to use Foundry to compile, deploy, and debug Ethereum smart contracts on the demo EVM network. You can follow the same steps to perform these actions on your Tanssi EVM network by replacing the RPC URL and Chain ID shown in the examples.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To get started, you will need the following:

 - An account with funds
 - [Foundry installed](https://getfoundry.sh/introduction/installation/){target=\_blank}

## Creating a Foundry Project {: #creating-a-foundry-project }

You will need to create a Foundry project if you don't already have one. You can create one by completing the following steps:

1. Install Foundry with the below commands. The Windows instructions are noticeably different as you'll have to install Rust and then build Foundry from source

    === "Ubuntu"

        ```bash
        curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup
        ```

    === "MacOS"

        ```bash
        curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash foundryup
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs/ | sh
        cargo install --git https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry foundry-cli anvil --bins --locked
        ```

     After installing, you may need to restart your terminal session or add `foundryup` to your PATH.

2. Create the project, which will create a folder with three folders within it:

    ```bash
    forge init foundry
    ```

You may get an error, such as `The target directory is a part of or on its own an already initialized git repository,
and it requires clean working and staging areas, including no untracked files.` To solve this, you can add files and make a commit if you are maintaining this project within a GitHub repository. Otherwise, you can make a dummy commit without pushing. If you run `forge init foundry` once more, you'll no longer have the error.

With the default project created, you should see three folders.  

- `lib` - all of the project's dependencies in the form of git submodules
- `src` - where to put your smart contracts (with functionality)
- `test` - where to put the forge tests for your project, which are written in Solidity

In addition to these three folders, a git project will also be created along with a prewritten `.gitignore` file with relevant file types and folders ignored.

## The Source Folder {: #the-src-folder }

The preconfigured `foundry` repo includes `Counter.sol` in the `src` folder, as well as a `Counter.s.sol` in the `script` folder and `Counter.t.sol` in the `test` folder. You should delete these files to avoid errors when trying to compile and deploy `MyToken.sol`. You can do so with the following command:

```bash
rm src/Counter.sol script/Counter.s.sol test/Counter.t.sol
```

In the following steps, you will be deploying an ERC-20 contract. In the contracts directory, you can create the `MyToken.sol` file:

```bash
cd src
touch MyToken.sol
```

Open the file and add the following contract to it:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Import OpenZeppelin Contract
import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

// This ERC-20 contract mints the specified amount of tokens to the contract creator
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MYTOK") {
    _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
  }
}
```

Before you attempt to compile, install OpenZeppelin contracts as a dependency. You may have to commit previous changes to git beforehand. By default, Foundry uses git submodules instead of npm packages, so the traditional npm import path and command are not used. Instead, use the name of OpenZeppelin's GitHub repository:

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

## Compiling Solidity {: #compiling-solidity }

Once all dependencies have been installed, you can compile the contract:

```bash
forge build
```

![Foundry Contract Compile](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-1.webp)

After compilation, two folders will be created: `out` and `cache`. The ABI and bytecode for your contracts will be contained within the `out` folder. These two folders are already ignored by the `.gitignore` included in the default Foundry project initialization.

## Deploying the Contract {: #deploying-the-contract }

Deploying the contract with Forge takes a single command, but you will need to include an RPC endpoint, a funded private key, and constructor arguments. `MyToken.sol` asks for an initial supply of tokens in its constructor, so the following command includes 100 as a constructor argument. You can deploy the `MyToken.sol` contract using the following command modified for the correct network:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }} \
--constructor-args 100 \
--private-key INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
src/MyToken.sol:MyToken
```

After a few seconds, the contract is deployed, and you should see the address in the terminal.

![Foundry Contract Deploy](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-2.webp)

Congratulations, your contract is live! Save the address, as you will use it to interact with this contract instance in the next step.

## Interacting with the Contract {: #interacting-with-the-contract }

Foundry includes [Cast](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview/){target=\_blank}, a CLI for performing Ethereum RPC calls.

Try to retrieve your token's name using Cast, where `INSERT_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is the address of the contract that you deployed in the previous section:

```bash
cast call INSERT_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "name()" --rpc-url {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
```

You should get this data in hexadecimal format:

```text
0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000074d79546f6b656e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

This is far from readable, but you can use Cast to convert it into your desired format. In this case, the data is text, so you can convert it into ASCII characters to see "My Token":

![Foundry Contract View](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-3.webp)

```bash
cast --to-ascii 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000074d79546f6b656e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

You can also mutate data with Cast as well. Try burning tokens by sending them to the zero address.

```bash
cast send --private-key INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY \
--rpc-url {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }} \
--chain {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }} \
INSERT_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
"transfer(address,uint256)" 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 1
```

The transaction will be signed by your EVM account and be broadcast to the network. The output should look similar to:

![Foundry Contract Interaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-4.webp)

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed and interacted with a contract using Foundry!

## Forking with Anvil {: #forking-with-anvil }

As previously mentioned, [Anvil](https://getfoundry.sh/anvil/overview/){target=\_blank} is a local TestNet node for development purposes that can fork preexisting networks. Forking the demo EVM network allows you to interact with live contracts deployed on the network.

To fork the demo EVM network from the command line, you can run the following command from within your Foundry project directory. You can also replace the RPC URL with the RPC URL of your Tanssi EVM network.

```bash
anvil --fork-url {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
```

Your forked instance will have 10 development accounts that are pre-funded with 10,000 test tokens. The forked instance is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`. The output in your terminal should resemble the following:

![Forking terminal screen](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-5.webp)

To verify you have forked the network, you can query the latest block number and compare it to the current block number of the [demo EVM network]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}){target=\_blank}.

```bash
curl --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8545 
```

If you convert the `result` from [hex to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html){target=\_blank}, you should get the latest block number from the time you forked the network.

From here, you can deploy new contracts to your forked instance of the demo EVM network (or any other Tanssi-powered EVM network) or interact with contracts already deployed. Building off of the previous example in this guide, you can make a call using Cast to check the balance of the minted MYTOK tokens in the account you deployed the contract with:

```bash
cast call INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" \
 INSERT_YOUR_ADDRESS --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

## Using Chisel {: #using-chisel }

[Chisel](https://getfoundry.sh/chisel/overview/){target=\_blank} is a Solidity REPL or shell. It allows a developer to write Solidity directly in the console for testing small snippets of code, letting developers skip the project setup and contract deployment steps for what should be a quick process.  

Since Chisel is mainly useful for quick testing, it can be used outside of a Foundry project. But, if executed within a Foundry project, it will keep the configurations within `foundry.toml` when running.  

For this example, you will be testing out some of the features of `abi` within Solidity because it is complex enough to demonstrate how Chisel could be useful. To get started using Chisel, run the following in the command line to start the shell:

```bash
chisel
```

In the shell, you can write Solidity code as if it were running within a function:

```solidity
bytes memory myData = abi.encode(100, true, "Build with Tanssi");
```

Let's say you were interested in how `abi` encoded data because you're looking into how to most efficiently store data on the blockchain and thus save gas. To view how the `myData` is stored in memory, you can use the following command while in the Chisel shell:

```bash
!memdump
```

`memdump` will dump all of the data in your current session. You'll likely see something like this below. If you aren't good at reading hexadecimal or if you don't know how ABI encoding works, then you might not be able to find where the `myData` variable has been stored.

![memdump in Chisel](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-6.webp)

Fortunately, Chisel lets you easily figure out where this information is stored. Using the `!rawstack` command, you can find the location in the stack where the value of a variable is:

```bash
!rawstack myData
```

In this situation, since `myData` is over 32 bytes in length, the memory pointer is displayed instead. But that's exactly what's needed since you already know the entirety of the stack from the `!memdump` command.

![rawstack in Chisel](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-7.webp)

The `!rawstack` command shows that the `myData` variable is stored at `0x80`, so when comparing this with the memory dump retrieved from the `!memdump` command, it looks like `myData` is stored like this:  

```text
[0x80:0xa0]: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0
[0xa0:0xc0]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064
[0xc0:0xe0]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
[0xe0:0x100]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060
[0x100:0x120]: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011
[0x120:0x140]: 0x4275696c6420776974682054616e737369000000000000000000000000000000
```

At first glance, this makes sense since `0xa0` has a value of `0x64`, which is equal to 100, and `0xc0` has a value of `0x01`, which is equal to true. If you want to learn more about how ABI-encoding works, the [Solidity documentation for ABI is helpful](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/abi-spec.html){target=\_blank}. In this case, there are a lot of zeros in this method of data packing, so as a smart contract developer, you might instead try to use structs or pack the data together more efficiently with bitwise code.  

Since you're done with this code, you can clear the state of Chisel so that it doesn't mess with any future logic that you want to try out (while running the same instance of Chisel):  

```bash
!clear
```

There's an even easier way to test with Chisel. When writing code that ends with a semicolon, `;`, Chisel will run it as a statement, storing its value in Chisel's runtime state. But if you only needed to see how the ABI-encoded data was represented, then you could get away with running the code as an expression. To try this out with the same `abi` example, write the following in the Chisel shell:  

```bash
abi.encode(100, true, "Build with Tanssi")
```

You should see something like the following:  

![Expressions in Chisel](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-8.webp)

While it doesn't display the data in the same way, you still get the contents of the data, and it also further breaks down how the information is coded, such as letting you know that the `0xa0` value defines the length of the data.  

By default, when you leave the Chisel shell, none of the data persists. But you can instruct Chisel to do so. For example, you can take the following steps to store a variable:

1. Store a `uint256` in Chisel

    ```bash
    uint256 myNumber = 101;
    ```

2. Store the session with `!save`. For this example, you can use the number `1` as a save ID

    ```bash
    !save 1
    ```

3. Quit the session  
    ```bash
    !quit
    ```

Then to view and interact with your stored Chisel states, you can take the following steps:

1. View a list of saved Chisel states

    ```bash
    chisel list
    ```

2. Load your stored state by providing the `chisel load` command followed by the ID of the state

    ```bash
    chisel load 1
    ```

3. View the `uint256` saved in Chisel from the previous set of steps

    ```bash
    !rawstack myNumber
    ```  

![Saving state in Chisel](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/foundry/foundry-9.webp)

You can even fork networks while using Chisel:

```bash
!fork {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
```

Then, for example, you can query the balance of the Alice account on the demo EVM network:  

```text
0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55.balance
```

## Foundry with Hardhat {: #foundry-with-hardhat }  

Often, there will be the case where a project that you wish to integrate with has all of its setup within [Hardhat](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/){target=\_blank}, making it an arduous task to convert the entirety of the project into Foundry. This additional work is avoidable by creating a hybrid project that uses both Hardhat and Foundry features together. This is possible with Hardhat's [hardhat-foundry plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-foundry){target=\_blank}.  

To convert your preexisting Foundry project to a hybrid project, you will essentially have to install a Hardhat project into the same folder:  

```bash
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry
npx hardhat init
```

For more information, please refer to our documentation on [Creating a Hardhat Project](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/#creating-a-hardhat-project){target=\_blank}.

After initializing the new Hardhat project, a few new folders and files should appear: `contracts`, `hardhat.config.js`, `scripts`, and `test/Lock.js`. You'll need to make a few modifications to create a hybrid project:

1. Edit the `hardhat.config.js` file within your repository. Open it up, and at the top, add the following:  

    ```javascript
    require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-foundry');
    ```

    After adding the `hardhat-foundry` plugin, the typical `contracts` folders for Hardhat will not work because now Hardhat expects all smart contracts to be stored within Foundry's `src` folder

2. Move all smart contracts within the `contracts` folder into the `src` folder, and then delete the `contracts` folder
3. Edit the `foundry.toml` file to ensure that dependencies installed via Git submodules and npm can be compiled by the Forge tool. Edit the `profile.default` to ensure that the `libs` entry has both `lib` and `node_modules`:  

    ```toml
    [profile.default]
    src = 'src'
    out = 'out'
    libs = ['lib', 'node_modules']
    solc = '0.8.20'
    evm_version = 'london'
    ```

Now both `forge build` and `npx hardhat compile` should work regardless of the dependencies.  

Both `forge test` and `npx hardhat test` should now be able to access all smart contracts and dependencies. `forge test` will only test the Solidity tests, whereas `npx hardhat test` will only test the JavaScript tests. If you would like to use them in conjunction, then you can create a new script within your `package.json` file:  

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "npx hardhat test && forge test"
}
```

You can run this command with:  

```bash
npm run test
```

Finally, while not necessary, it could be worthwhile to move all JavaScript scripts from the `scripts` folder into Foundry's `script` folder and delete the `scripts` folder so that you don't have two folders that serve the same purpose.

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed and interacted with smart contracts on your Tanssi EVM network using Foundry! For more information, be sure to check out the [Foundry Book](https://getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}.

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org){target=\_blank} is an Ethereum development environment that helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to building smart contracts and dApps. Hardhat can be used with any EVM network to build, compile, and deploy smart contracts, thanks to the seamless compatibility of Tanssi-powered EVM networks.

This guide will cover how to use Hardhat to compile, deploy, and interact with Ethereum smart contracts deployed to the demo Tanssi EVM network. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi-powered EVM network by simply adding the RPC URL of your Tanssi network to your EVM Wallet and switching networks to it.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For this guide, you'll need to have MetaMask installed and configured to work with your Tanssi EVM network. You can follow [this guide to configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

## Creating a Hardhat Project {: #creating-a-hardhat-project }

You must create a Hardhat project if you don't already have one. You can create one by completing the following steps:

1. Create a directory for your project

    ```sh
    mkdir hardhat && cd hardhat
    ```

2. Initialize the project, which will create a `package.json` file

    ```sh
    npm init -y
    ```

3. Install Hardhat

    ```sh
    npm install hardhat
    ```

4. Create a project

    ```sh
    npx hardhat init
    ```

    !!! note
        `npx` is used to run executables installed locally in your project. Although Hardhat can be installed globally, installing it locally in each project is recommended so you can control the version on a project-by-project basis.

5. A menu will appear allowing you to create a new project or use a sample project. For this example, you can choose **Create an empty hardhat.config.js**

  <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt="❯ Create an empty hardhat.config.js"></span>
  <span data-ty>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quit </span>
</div>

This will create a Hardhat config file (`hardhat.config.js`) in your project directory.

Once you have your Hardhat project, you can also install the [Ethers plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-ethers){target=\_blank}. This provides a convenient way to use the [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} library to interact with the network. To install it, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers
```

Additionally, you'll need to install the `hardhat-ignition-ethers` plugin to enable deployment of smart contracts with Hardhat Ignition. You can install it with the following command:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers
```

## The Contract File {: #the-contract-file }

With your empty project created, you will create a `contracts` directory next. You can do so by running the following command:

```sh
mkdir contracts && cd contracts
```

The smart contract that you'll deploy as an example will be called `Box`, it will let you store a value that can be retrieved later. In the `contracts` directory, you can create the `Box.sol` file:

```sh
touch Box.sol
```

Open the file and add the following contract to it:

```solidity
// contracts/Box.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.1;

contract Box {
    uint256 private value;

    // Emitted when the stored value changes
    event ValueChanged(uint256 newValue);

    // Stores a new value in the contract
    function store(uint256 newValue) public {
        value = newValue;
        emit ValueChanged(newValue);
    }

    // Reads the last stored value
    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

## The Hardhat Configuration File {: #hardhat-configuration-file }

Before you can deploy the contract to your Tanssi network, you'll need to modify the Hardhat configuration file and create a secure file to store your private key in.

You can modify the `hardhat.config.js` file to use either the Tanssi demo EVM network or your own Tanssi network:

```js
// 1. Import the Ethers and Hardhat Ignition plugins required to interact with the contract
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers');
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers');

// 2. Add your private key that is funded with tokens of your Tanssi network
// This is for example purposes only - **never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';

module.exports = {
  // 3. Specify the Solidity version
  solidity: '0.8.1',
  networks: {
    // 4. Add the network specification for your Tanssi EVM network
    dancelight: {
      url: '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}',
      chainId: {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}, // Fill in the EVM ChainID for your Tanssi network
      accounts: [privateKey]
    }
  }
};
```

Congratulations! You are now ready for deployment!

## Compiling Solidity {: #compiling-solidity }

To compile the contract you can simply run:

```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx hardhat compile</span>
    <span data-ty>Compiled 8 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).</span>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

After compilation, an `artifacts` directory is created: it holds the bytecode and metadata of the contract, which are `.json` files. Adding this directory to your `.gitignore` is a good idea.

## Deploying the Contract {: #deploying-the-contract }

To deploy the contract, you'll use Hardhat Ignition, a declarative framework for deploying smart contracts. Hardhat Ignition is designed to make managing recurring tasks surrounding smart contract deployment and testing easy. For more information, be sure to check out the [Hardhat Ignition docs](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview){target=\_blank}. 

To set up the proper file structure for your Ignition module, create a folder named `ignition` and a subdirectory called `modules`.  Then add a new file to it called `Box.js`. You can take all three of these steps with the following command:

```sh
mkdir ignition ignition/modules && touch ignition/modules/Box.js
```

Next, you can write your Hardhat Ignition module. To get started, take the following steps:

1. Import the `buildModule` function from the Hardhat Ignition module
2. Export a module using `buildModule`
3. Use the `getAccount` method to select the deployer account
4. Specify custom gas price and gas limit settings for the deployment
5. Deploy the `Box` contract
6. Return an object from the module. This makes the `Box` contract accessible for interaction in Hardhat tests and scripts

```js
// 1.  Import the `buildModule` function from the Hardhat Ignition module
const { buildModule } = require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules');

// 2. Export a module using `buildModule`
module.exports = buildModule('BoxModule', (m) => {
  // 3. Use the `getAccount` method to select the deployer account
  const deployer = m.getAccount(0);

  // 4. Specify custom gas price and gas limit settings for the deployment
  const customGasPrice = 50000000000n;
  const customGasLimit = 1000000;

  // 5. Deploy the `Box` contract using the selected deployer account and custom gas settings
  const box = m.contract('Box', [], {
    from: deployer,
    gasPrice: customGasPrice,
    gasLimit: customGasLimit,
  });

  // 6. Return an object from the module including references to deployed contracts. This makes the deployed `Box` contract accessible for interaction in tests and scripts
  return { box };
});
```

To run the script and deploy the `Box.sol` contract, use the following command, which requires you to specify the network name as defined in your `hardhat.config.js`. Hardhat will deploy the contract to a local hardhat network by default if you don't specify a network.  

```sh
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Box.js --network dancelight
```

You'll be prompted to confirm the network you wish to deploy to. After a few seconds after you confirm, the contract is deployed, and you'll see the contract address in the terminal. If you're deploying to another Tanssi network, make sure that you specify the correct network. The network name must match how it's defined in `hardhat.config.js`. After a few seconds, the contract is deployed, and you should see the address in the terminal.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span> npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Box.js --network dancelight</span>
    <br>
    <span data-ty>✅ Confirm deploy to network dancelight (5678)? … yes</span>

    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

Congratulations, your contract is live! Save the address, as you will use it to interact with this contract instance in the next step.

## Interacting with the Contract {: #interacting-with-the-contract }

To interact with your newly deployed contract on your Tanssi network, you can launch the Hardhat `console` by running:

```sh
npx hardhat console --network dancelight
```

Next, you can take the following steps, entering one line at a time:

1. Create a local instance of the `Box.sol` contract

    ```js
    const Box = await ethers.getContractFactory('Box');
    ```

2. Connect the local instance to the deployed contract, using the address of the contract

    ```js
    const box = await Box.attach('0xa84caB60db6541573a091e5C622fB79e175E17be');
    ```

3. Interact with the attached contract. For this example, you can call the `store` method and store a simple value

    ```js
    await box.store(5);
    ```

Your EVM account will sign the transaction and broadcast it to the network. The output should look similar to:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input">npx hardhat console --network dancelight</span>
    <br>
    <span data-ty>Welcome to Node.js v20.9.0.</span>

Notice your address labeled `from`, the contract's address, and the `data` being passed. Now, you can retrieve the value by running:

```js
await box.retrieve();
```

You should see `5` or the value you initially stored.

!!! note
    If you run the retrieve command immediately after storing the value, you may see the old value. Rerunning the retrieval command after waiting a moment will return the correct value.

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed and interacted with a contract using Hardhat!

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers building dApps on top of Tanssi-powered EVM networks can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}, one of the most popular Ethereum development environments, to build, compile, and deploy their smart contracts. Remix can be used with any EVM network, thanks to the seamless compatibility of Tanssi-powered EVM networks.

This guide walks through the process of creating and deploying a Solidity-based smart contract to the Tanssi demo EVM network using the Remix IDE. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi EVM network by simply adding the RPC URL of your network to your EVM Wallet and switching networks to it.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For this guide, you'll need to have MetaMask installed and configured to work with your Tanssi EVM network. You can follow [this guide to configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

## Getting Started with Remix {: #getting-started-with-remix }

Now, you can head to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank} to get started. On the main screen, navigate to the **File Explorer** tab.

![File explorer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-1.webp)

Next, you can create a new file to save the Solidity smart contract. To do so, take the following steps:

1. Press the **Create New File** button on the left-hand side of **File Explorer**
2. Enter your desired filename, such as `MyToken.sol`

![Create a new file for your Solidity contract](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-2.webp)

Next, paste the following smart contract into the editor tab:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import 'https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/audit/2023-03/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol';

// This ERC-20 contract mints the specified amount of tokens to the contract creator.
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MYTOK") {
    _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
  }
}
```

![Paste the contract into the editor](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-3.webp)

This is a simple ERC-20 contract based on the [current OpenZeppelin ERC-20 template](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank}. It creates `MyToken` with symbol `MYTOK` and mints the entirety of the initial supply to the creator of the contract.

To compile your smart contract, take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Solidity compiler** tab
2. Press the **Compile MyToken.sol** button

![Compile MyToken.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-4.webp)

Your contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed to your Tanssi network.

## Deploying a Contract to Your Network Using Remix {: #deploying-a-contract-to-your-network-using-remix }

Now you can deploy the contract by navigating to the **Deployment** sidebar option. You need to change the topmost **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown from **JavaScript VM** to **Injected Web3**. This tells Remix to use the MetaMask injected provider, which will point it to your Tanssi-powered EVM network, so long as the selected network in your MetaMask is your Tanssi EVM network. If you need to change your network in MetaMask, you can easily do so, and Remix will update your account balances to reflect the network change.

![Change environment to injected Web3](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-5.webp)

As soon as you select **Injected Web3**, you will be prompted to allow Remix to connect to your MetaMask account. Then, take the following steps:

1. Select the account(s) that you would like to use with Remix
2. Press **Next**
3. Press **Connect**

![Select accounts to connect to Remix](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-6.webp)

Back on Remix, you should see the account you wish to use for deployment is now managed by MetaMask. To deploy your token contract, take the following steps:

1. Next to the **Deploy** button, specify an initial supply of 8 million tokens. Since this contract uses the default of 18 decimals, the value to put in the box is `8000000000000000000000000`. Once you have entered this value, press **Deploy**
2. Confirm the contract deployment transaction in MetaMask.

![Enter an token balance and deploy](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-7.webp)

After you press **Confirm** and the deployment is complete, you will see the transaction listed in MetaMask. The contract will appear under **Deployed Contracts** in Remix. You can access the address of the deployed contract by pressing the copy button.

![Confirmed label on a transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-8.webp)

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it from within Remix. To familiarize yourself with interacting with a smart contract from Remix, take the following steps:

1. Expand the contract under the **Deployed Contracts** section
2. Paste in your address (the address that deployed the token contract) next to the balanceOf method and press **balanceOf**. You should see the entirety of the balance of the ERC-20 belonging to that address
3. Press **Decimals** to see the number of decimal points the token has
4. Press **Name** to see the name you assigned the token
5. Press **Symbol** to see the token symbol
6. Press **Initial Supply** and you should see `8000000000000000000000000`
7. Copy the contract address by clicking the button next to the contract name and address. You'll need it in the next section

![Interact with the contract from Remix](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-9.webp)

## Interacting with an ERC-20 on Your Network from MetaMask {: #interacting-with-an-erc-20-on-your-network-from-metamask }

Now, open MetaMask to add the newly deployed ERC-20 tokens. Make sure you are connected to the account that deployed the token contract. Additionally, make sure you have copied the contract's address from Remix.

To add the token to MetaMask, take the following steps:

1. Click on the **Tokens** tab as shown below
2. Press **Import tokens**

![Add a token](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-10.webp)

Then, take the following steps:

1. Paste the copied contract address into the **Token contract address** field. The **Token symbol** and **Token decimal** fields should be automatically populated
2. Press **Next**

![Paste the copied contract address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-11.webp)

After clicking **Next**, you will need to confirm that you want to add these tokens to your MetaMask account. Click **Import** and you should see a balance of 8 million MyTokens in MetaMask:

![Add the tokens to your MetaMask account](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-12.webp)

Now you can send some of these ERC-20 tokens to the other account that you have set up in MetaMask. Click **Send** to initiate the transfer of 500 MyTokens and select the destination account.

After clicking **Next**, you will be asked to confirm (similar to what is pictured below).

![Confirmation of the token transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-13.webp)

Click **Confirm** and, after the transaction is complete, you will see a confirmation and a reduction of the MyToken account balance from the sender account in MetaMask.

![Verify the reduction in account balance](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/remix/remix-14.webp)

You can also look up the transaction on [your Tanssi network's explorer](https://tanssi-evmexplorer.netlify.app){target=\_blank} to verify the transaction status.

# Using thirdweb on Tanssi

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com){target=\_blank} is a complete Web3 development framework that provides everything you need to develop smart contracts, build dApps, and more.

With thirdweb, you can access tools to help you through every phase of the dApp development cycle. You can create your own custom smart contracts or use any of thirdweb's prebuilt contracts to get started quickly. From there, you can use thirdweb's CLI to deploy your smart contracts. Then you can interact with your smart contracts by creating a Web3 application using the language of your choice, including but not limited to React and TypeScript. 

This guide will show you some of the thirdweb features you can use to develop smart contracts and dApps on Tanssi EVM networks. To check out all of the features thirdweb has to offer, please refer to the [thirdweb documentation site](https://portal.thirdweb.com){target=\_blank}. 

## Create Contract {: #create-contract }

To create a new smart contract using the [thirdweb CLI](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli){target=\_blank}, follow these steps:

1. In your CLI, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx thirdweb create contract
    ```

2. Input your preferences for the command line prompts:
    1. Give your project a name
    2. Choose your preferred framework: **Hardhat** or **Foundry**
    3. Name your smart contract
    4. Choose the type of base contract: **Empty**, **ERC20**, **ERC721**, or **ERC1155**
    5. Add any desired [extensions](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/extensions){target=\_blank}
3. Once created, navigate to your project’s directory and open in your preferred code editor
4. If you open the `contracts` folder, you will find your smart contract; this is your smart contract written in Solidity

    The following is code for an `ERC721Base` contract without specified extensions. It implements all of the logic inside the [`ERC721Base.sol`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol){target=\_blank} contract; which implements the [`ERC721A`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/eip/ERC721A.sol){target=\_blank} standard.

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    import '@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol';

    contract Contract is ERC721Base {
        constructor(
            string memory _name,
            string memory _symbol,
            address _royaltyRecipient,
            uint128 _royaltyBps
        ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
    }
    ```

    This contract inherits the functionality of `ERC721Base` through the following steps:

    - Importing the `ERC721Base` contract
    - Inheriting the contract by declaring that your contract is an `ERC721Base` contract
    - Implementing any required methods, such as the constructor

5. After modifying your contract with your desired custom logic, you can deploy it to a Tanssi EVM network using [Deploy](#deploy-contract). That will be covered in the next section!
5. After modifying your contract with your desired custom logic, you can deploy it to a Tanssi EVM network using [Deploy](#deploy-contract). That will be covered in the next section!

Alternatively, you can deploy a prebuilt contract for NFTs, tokens, or marketplace directly from the thirdweb Explore page:

1. Go to the [thirdweb Explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore){target=\_blank}

    ![thirdweb Explore](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/thirdweb/thirdweb-1.webp)

2. Choose the type of contract you want to deploy from the available options: NFTs, tokens, marketplace, and more
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure and deploy your contract

For more information on different contracts available on Explore, check out [thirdweb’s documentation on prebuilt contracts](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts){target=\_blank}.

## Deploy Contract {: #deploy-contract }

Deploy is thirdweb's tool that allows you to easily deploy a smart contract to any EVM compatible network without configuring RPC URLs, exposing your private keys, writing scripts, and other additional setup such as verifying your contract.
Deploy is thirdweb's tool that allows you to easily deploy a smart contract to any EVM compatible network without configuring RPC URLs, exposing your private keys, writing scripts, and other additional setup such as verifying your contract.

1. To deploy your smart contract using deploy, navigate to the `contracts` directory of your project and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    npx thirdweb deploy
    ```

    Executing this command will trigger the following actions:

    - Compiling all the contracts in the current directory
    - Providing the option to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy
    - Uploading your contract source code (ABI) to IPFS

2. When it is completed, it will open a dashboard interface to finish filling out the parameters

    - `_name` - contract name
    - `_symbol` - symbol or "ticker"
    - `_royaltyRecipient` - wallet address to receive royalties from secondary sales
    - `_royaltyBps` - basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty recipient for each secondary sale, e.g. 500 = 5%

3. Select the desired network, e.g., the Tanssi demo EVM network or your own network
4. Manage additional settings on your contract’s dashboard as needed such as uploading NFTs, configuring permissions, and more

    ![thirdweb deploy](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/thirdweb/thirdweb-2.webp)

For additional information on Deploy, please reference [thirdweb’s documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/){target=\_blank}.

## Create Application {: #create-application }

thirdweb offers SDKs for a range of programming languages, such as React, React Native, TypeScript, and Unity. You'll start off by creating an application and then you can choose which SDK to use:

1. In your CLI run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx thirdweb create --app
    ```

2. Input your preferences for the command line prompts:

    1. Give your project a name
    2. Choose your preferred framework: **Next.js**, **Vite**, or **React Native**. For this example, select **Vite**

3. Use the React or TypeScript SDK to interact with your application’s functions. This will be covered in the following section on interacting with a contract

### Specify Client ID {: #specify-client-id }

Before you launch your dApp (locally or publicly deployed), you must have a thirdweb Client ID associated with your project. A thirdweb Client ID is synonymous with an API key. You can create a free API key by [signing into your thirdweb account, navigating to **Settings**, and clicking on **API Keys**](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys){target=\_blank}.

Press **Create API Key** then take the following steps:

1. Give your API key a name
2. Enter the allowed domains that the API key should accept requests from. It's recommended that you allow only necessary domains, but for development purposes, you can select **Allow all domains**
3. Press **Next** and confirm the prompt on the next page

![thirdweb create API key](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/thirdweb/thirdweb-3.webp)

!!! note
    The respective name for your Client ID variable will vary with the framework you've chosen, e.g., Vite will be `VITE_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID`, Next.js will be `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID`, and React Native will be `EXPO_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID`.

Finally, specify your Client ID (API Key) in your `.env` file. Your `.env` file must be located at the root directory of the project (e.g., not the `src` folder).

If you generated your thirdweb app with Vite, you'll have a `client.ts` file that looks like the below. As long you've created a `.env` file with your thirdweb API Key (Client ID) defined in `VITE_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID`, you can leave the `client.ts` as is and proceed to the next section.

```typescript title="client.ts"
import { createThirdwebClient } from 'thirdweb';

// Replace this with your client ID string.
// Refer to https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/client on how to get a client ID
const clientId = import.meta.env.VITE_TEMPLATE_CLIENT_ID;

export const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: clientId,
});
```

!!! note
    If you don't create a Client ID and specify is correctly in your `.env` file, you'll get a blank screen when trying to build the web app. There is no error message shown without digging into the console, so ensure you've set your Client ID correctly first and foremost.

### Run Locally {: #run-locally }

To run your dApp locally for testing and debugging purposes, use the command: 

```bash
yarn dev
```

The app will compile and specify the localhost and port number for you to visit in your browser.

![thirdweb run locally](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-environments/thirdweb/thirdweb-4.webp)

### Configure Chain {: #configure-chain }

thirdweb offers a small number of chains from `@thirdweb/chains` and does not include Tanssi networks in that list, so you'll need to specify the network details including chain ID and RPC URL. You can create a custom chain with [`defineChain`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/defineChain){target=\_blank} as follows:

```typescript title="chains.ts"
    import { defineChain } from 'thirdweb';
    const tanssi = defineChain({
      id: {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }},
      rpc: '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}',
    });
```

## thirdweb SDK {: #thirdweb-sdk }

The following sections will provide an overview of fundamental methods of the thirdweb SDK and how to interact with them. Each code snippet will showcase the relevant import statements and demonstrate using the method in a typical scenario. This guide is intended to be a quick reference guide to the most common thirdweb methods that dApp developers will use. However, it does not include information on each and every thirdweb offering. For details on the entirety of thirdweb's offerings, be sure to visit the [thirdweb documentation site](https://portal.thirdweb.com/){target=\_blank}.

### Accounts and Wallets {: #accounts-and-wallets }

thirdweb distinguishes between accounts and wallets in the SDK. In the eyes of the thirdweb SDK, an account always has a single blockchain address and can sign messages, transactions, and typed data, but it cannot be "connected" or "disconnected." In contrast, a wallet contains one or more accounts, can be connected or disconnected, and delegates the signing tasks to its accounts. 

The below code snippet demonstrates how to initialize and connect a MetaMask wallet using the thirdweb SDK, then sign and send a transaction, retrieving the transaction hash. This process is applicable to any of the 300+ wallet connectors supported by the SDK.

???+ code "initialize.ts"
    ```typescript
    import { sendTransaction } from 'thirdweb';
// MetaMask wallet used for example, the pattern is the same for all wallets
import { createWallet } from 'thirdweb/wallets';

// Initialize the wallet. thirdweb supports 300+ wallet connectors
const wallet = createWallet('io.metamask');

// Connect the wallet. This returns a promise that resolves to the connected account
const account = await wallet.connect({
  // Pass the client you created with `createThirdwebClient()`
  client,
});

// Sign and send a transaction with the account. Returns the transaction hash
const { transactionHash } = await sendTransaction({
  // Assuming you have called `prepareTransaction()` or `prepareContractCall()` before, which returns the prepared transaction to send
  transaction,
  // Pass the account to sign the transaction with
  account,
});
    ```

### Get Contract {: #get-contract }

To connect to your contract, use the SDK’s [`getContract`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getContract){target=\_blank} method. As an example, you could fetch data from an [incrementer contract on the Tanssi demo EVM network]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}address/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D?tab=contract){target=\_blank}.

```typescript
import { getContract } from 'thirdweb';
import { client } from './client';

const myContract = getContract({
  client,
  chain: tanssi,
  address: 0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D, // Incrementer contract address on demo EVM network
  abi: '[{"inputs":[],"name":"increment","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"number","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"timestamp","outputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"","type":"uint256"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"}]';
});
```

### Calling Contract Functions {: #calling-contract-functions }

To call a contract in the latest version of the SDK, you can use [`prepareContractCall`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/transactions/prepare){target=\_blank}.

```typescript
import { prepareContractCall, toWei } from 'thirdweb';

const tx = prepareContractCall({
  contract,
  // Pass the method signature that you want to call
  method: 'function mintTo(address to, uint256 amount)',
  // Pass the params for that method.
  // Their types are automatically inferred based on the method signature
  params: ['0x123...', toWei('100')],
});
```

Returning to our [incrementer contract]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}address/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D?tab=contract){target=\_blank}, preparing a call to increment the contract looks like the following:

```typescript
import { prepareContractCall } from 'thirdweb';

const tx = prepareContractCall({
  contract,
  // Pass the method signature that you want to call
  method: 'function increment()',
  // Increment takes no params so we are leaving an empty array
  params: [],
});
```

### Preparing Raw Transactions {: #preparing-raw-transactions }

You can also prepare a transaction directly with encoded data. To do so, you'll use thirdweb's [`prepareTransaction` method](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/transactions/prepare){target=\_blank} and specify the `to`, `value`, `chain`, and `client` values directly. 

```typescript
import { prepareTransaction, toWei } from 'thirdweb';

const transaction = prepareTransaction({
  // The account that will be the receiver
  to: '0x456...',
  // The value is the amount of ether you want to send with the transaction
  value: toWei('1'),
  // The chain to execute the transaction on. This assumes you already set up
  // the Tanssi demo EVM network as a custom chain, as shown in the configure chain section
  chain: tanssi,
  // Your thirdweb client
  client,
});
```

### Reading Contract State {: #read-contract-state }

Use the [`readContract` function](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/transactions/read){target=\_blank} to call any read functions on your contract by passing in the Solidity method signature and any parameters.

```typescript
import { readContract } from 'thirdweb';

const balance = await readContract({
  contract: contract,
  method: 'function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)',
  params: ['0x123...'],
});
```

For a function that takes no parameters, such as the number function that returns the current number stored in the [incrementer contract]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}address/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D?tab=contract){target=\_blank}, you simply need to provide the function name as follows: 

```typescript
import { readContract } from 'thirdweb';

const number = await readContract({
  contract: contract,
  method: 'number',
  params: [],
});
```

Did you know? With the [thirdweb CLI](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli){target=\_blank}, you can easily generate functions for all of the possible calls to a contract. To do so, run the following command in the command line: 

```bash
npx thirdweb generate INSERT_CHAIN_ID/INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

Both the chain ID and the contract address are required. As an example, if you wanted to generate the functions for the [incrementer contract on the Tanssi demo EVM network]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}address/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D?tab=contract){target=\_blank} , you would use the following command:

```bash
npx thirdweb generate {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D
```

The file generated with all of the corresponding methods will be placed in a directory labelled `thirdweb/CHAIN_ID/CONTRACT_ADDRESS`. In the example shown above, the output file is located at `thirdweb/{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}/0xC12f6fA2d1CA8f875bD25555e8883f1dDa40a93D.ts`. For more information, see the [thirdweb's docs on the CLI](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli/generate){target=\_blank}.

### Sending a Transaction {: #sending-a-transaction }

Every transaction sent using the SDK must first be prepared. This preparation process is synchronous and lightweight, requiring no network requests. Additionally, it provides type-safe definitions for your contract calls.

You can prepare a transaction as follows:

```typescript title="Prepare a transaction"
import { prepareTransaction, toWei } from 'thirdweb';

const transaction = prepareTransaction({
  to: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890',
  chain: tanssi,
  client: thirdwebClient,
  value: toWei('1.0'),
  gasPrice: 150n,
});
```

After the transaction is prepared, you can send it as follows:

```typescript title="Send a transaction"
import { sendTransaction } from 'thirdweb';

const { transactionHash } = await sendTransaction({
  account,
  transaction,
});
```

You can optionally use `sendAndConfirmTransaction` to wait for the transaction to be mined. This is relevant if you want to block the user from continuing until the transaction is confirmed. 

```typescript title="Send and Confirm a Transaction"
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from 'thirdweb';
import { createWallet } from 'thirdweb/wallets';

const wallet = createWallet('io.metamask');
const account = await wallet.connect({ client });

const receipt = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({
  transaction,
  account,
});
```

### Transaction Utilities {: #transaction-utilites }

thirdweb provides a number of helpful utility methods surrounding preparing and sending transactions. 

You can estimate the gas used by a transaction as follows: 

```typescript title="Estimating gas"
import { estimateGas } from 'thirdweb';

const gasEstimate = await estimateGas({ transaction });
console.log('estmated gas used', gasEstimate);
```

You can estimate the gas cost in Ether and Wei as follows: 

```typescript title="Estimating gas cost"
import { estimateGas } from 'thirdweb';

const gasCost = await estimateGasCost({ transaction });
console.log('cost in ether', gasCost.ether);
```

thirdweb also provides a handy way to simulate transactions and verify their integrity before actually submitting it to the blockchain. You can simulate a transaction as follows:

```typescript title="Simulate a transaction"
import { simulateTransaction } from 'thirdweb';

const result = await simulateTransaction({ transaction });
console.log('simulation result', result);
```

You can encode transaction data to act on later by taking the following steps: 

```typescript title="Encode transaction data"
import { encode } from 'thirdweb';

const data = await encode(transaction);
console.log('encoded data', data);
```

### ConnectButton {: #connect-button }

Perhaps the first and most important interaction users will have with your dApp is connecting their wallet. thirdweb provides an easy and highly customizable way for you to enable this. thirdweb provides a highly customizable [`ConnectButton`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react/v5/components/ConnectButton){target=\_blank} to tailor it to your desired wallets. The `ConnectButton` accepts an optional `wallets` parameter with an array of wallets. You can add or remove wallets from the `wallets` array to change the options available to users. thirdweb also offers a [`ConnectButton` Playground](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/playground){target=\_blank} to customize and view changes for the `ConnectButton` in real-time, given the button's high degree of flexibility.

```typescript title="ConnectButton"
import { ConnectButton } from 'thirdweb/react';
import { createWallet, inAppWallet } from 'thirdweb/wallets';
 
const wallets = [
  inAppWallet(),
  createWallet('io.metamask'),
  createWallet('com.coinbase.wallet'),
  createWallet('me.rainbow'),
];
 
function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deploy Application {: #deploy-application }

As a reminder, you can build your example project locally by running:
 
```bash
yarn dev
```

To host your static web application on decentralized storage, run:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy --app
```

Running this command builds your application for production and stores it using [Storage](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/functions#storage){target=\_blank}, thirdweb's decentralized file management solution. It uploads your built application to IPFS, a decentralized storage network, and generates a unique URL that provides a persistent hosting location for your application on the web.

If you have any further questions or encounter any issues during the process, please reach out to thirdweb support at [support.thirdweb.com](http://support.thirdweb.com){target=\_blank}.

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} library provides a set of tools to interact with Ethereum nodes with JavaScript, similar to [Web3.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank}. Tanssi-powered EVM networks have an Ethereum-like API available that is fully compatible with Ethereum-style JSON RPC invocations. Therefore, developers can leverage this compatibility and use the Ethers.js library to interact with a Tanssi EVM network node as if they were doing so on Ethereum. For more information on Ethers.js, check their [documentation site](https://docs.ethers.org/v6){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use the Ethers.js library for your Tanssi EVM network. Next, to showcase the library in action, you'll use Ethers.js to send a transaction and deploy a contract on a Tanssi demo EVM appchain running on [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi EVM appchain by simply changing the endpoint. 

If you prefer video tutorials, you can follow along with the corresponding videos at the top of this page for [Sending Transactions with Ethers.js](#send-a-transaction) and [Deploying Contracts with Ethers.js](#deploy-a-contract).

!!! note
    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Node.js and a package manager (such as npm or yarn) installed. To learn how to install Node.js, please check their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\blank}.
    
    Also, make sure you've initialized a `package.json` file for ES6 modules. You can initialize a default `package.json` file using npm by running the following command `npm init --yes`.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

 - An account with funds in the Tanssi EVM network you are testing with

## Installing Ethers.js {: #install-ethersjs }

For this guide, you'll need to install the Ethers.js library and the Solidity compiler. To install both NPM packages, you can run the following command:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install ethers solc@0.8.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add ethers solc@0.8.0
    ```

## Setting up the Ethers Provider {: #setting-up-the-ethers-provider }

Throughout this guide, you'll create several scripts that provide various functionalities, such as sending a transaction, deploying a contract, and interacting with a deployed contract. In most of these scripts you'll need to create an [Ethers provider](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/){target=\_blank} to interact with the network.

To create a provider, you can take the following steps:

1. Import the `ethers` library
2. Define the `providerRPC` object, which can include the network configurations for any of the networks you want to send a transaction on. You'll include the `name`, `rpc`, and `chainId` for each network
3. Create the `provider` using the `ethers.JsonRpcProvider` method

```js
// 1. Import ethers
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// 2. Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    // Insert your RPC URL here
    rpc: '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}',
    chainId: {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}, // {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_hex_id }} in hex,
  },
};
// 3. Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
  providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, 
  {
    chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
    name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
  }
);
```

Save this code snippet as you'll need it for the scripts that are used in the following sections.

## Send a Transaction {: #send-a-transaction }

During this section, you'll be creating a couple of scripts. The first one will be to check the balances of your accounts before trying to send a transaction. The second script will actually send the transaction.

You can also use the balance script to check the account balances after the transaction has been sent.

### Check Balances Script {: #check-balances-script }

You'll only need one file to check the balances of both addresses before and after the transaction is sent.  To get started, you can create a `balances.js` file by running:

```bash
touch balances.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
2. Define the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` variables
3. Create the asynchronous `balances` function which wraps the `provider.getBalance` method
4. Use the `provider.getBalance` function to fetch the balances for the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` addresses. You can also leverage the `ethers.formatEther` function to transform the balance into a more readable number in ETH
5. Lastly, run the `balances` function

```js
// 1. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 2. Create address variables
const addressFrom = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM';
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// 3. Create balances function
const balances = async () => {
  // 4. Fetch balances
  const balanceFrom = ethers.formatEther(await provider.getBalance(addressFrom));
  const balanceTo = ethers.formatEther(await provider.getBalance(addressTo));

  console.log(`The balance of ${addressFrom} is: ${balanceFrom} {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`);
  console.log(`The balance of ${addressTo} is: ${balanceTo} {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`);
};

// 5. Call the balances function
balances();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import ethers
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    rpc: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
    chainId: 5678, // 0x162E in hex,
  },
};
// Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
});

// Define addresses
const addressFrom = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM';
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// Create balances function
const balances = async () => {
  // Fetch balances
  const balanceFrom = ethers.formatEther(
    await provider.getBalance(addressFrom)
  );
  const balanceTo = ethers.formatEther(await provider.getBalance(addressTo));

  console.log(`The balance of ${addressFrom} is: ${balanceFrom} TANGO`);
  console.log(`The balance of ${addressTo} is: ${balanceTo} TANGO`);
};

// Call the balances function
balances();
    ```

To run the script and fetch the account balances, you can run the following command:

```bash
node balances.js
```

If successful, the balances for the origin and receiving address will be displayed in your terminal in {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node balances.js</span>
  <span data-ty>The balance of 0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55 is: 20.0 TANGO
    <br> The balance of 0x8841701Dba3639B254D9CEe712E49D188A1e941e is: 1.0 TANGO
  </span>
</div>

### Send Transaction Script {: #send-transaction-script }

You'll only need one file for executing a transaction between accounts. For this example, you'll be transferring 1 {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token from an origin address (from which you hold the private key) to another address. To get started, you can create a `transaction.js` file by running:

```bash
touch transaction.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
2. Define the `privateKey` and the `addressTo` variables. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
3. Create a wallet using the `privateKey` and `provider` from the previous steps. The wallet instance is used to sign transactions
4. Create the asynchronous `send` function, which wraps the transaction object and the `wallet.sendTransaction` method
5. Create the transaction object, which only requires the recipient's address and the amount to send. Note that `ethers.parseEther` can be used, which handles the necessary unit conversions from Ether to Wei - similar to using `ethers.parseUnits(value, 'ether')`
6. Send the transaction using the `wallet.sendTransaction` method and then use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction receipt is returned
7. Lastly, run the `send` function

```js
// 1. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 2. Create account variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// 3. Create wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// 4. Create send function
const send = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to send transaction from ${wallet.address} to ${addressTo}`);

  // 5. Create tx object
  const tx = {
    to: addressTo,
    value: ethers.parseEther('1'),
  };

  // 6. Sign and send tx - wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx);
  await createReceipt.wait();
  console.log(`Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.hash}`);
};

// 7. Call the send function
send();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import ethers
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    rpc: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
    chainId: 5678, // 0x162E in hex,
  },
};

// Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
});

// Define accounts and wallet
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// Create send function
const send = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Attempting to send transaction from ${wallet.address} to ${addressTo}`
  );

  // Create transaction
  const tx = {
    to: addressTo,
    value: ethers.parseEther('1'),
  };

  // Send transaction and get hash
  const createReceipt = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx);
  await createReceipt.wait();
  console.log(`Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.hash}`);
};

// Call the send function
send();
    ```

To run the script, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node transaction.js
```

If the transaction was successful, in your terminal you'll see the transaction hash has been printed out.

You can also use the `balances.js` script to check that the balances for the origin and receiving accounts have changed. The entire workflow would look like this:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node transaction.js</span>
  <span data-ty>Attempting to send transaction from 0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55 to 0x8841701 Dba3639B254D9CEe712E49D188A1e941e
    <br> Transaction successful with hash: 0x29d87c00704b949cb4cc04fdc6c98d53b3c0ec4fb3ffe0c52864a73 b586f563c
  </span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node balances.js</span>
  <span data-ty>The balance of 0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55 is: 18.999958 TANGO
    <br> The balance of 0x8841701Dba3639B254D9CEe712E49D188A1e941e is: 2.0 TANGO
  </span>
</div>

## Deploy a Contract {: #deploy-a-contract }

The contract you'll be compiling and deploying in the next couple of sections is a simple incrementer contract, arbitrarily named `Incrementer.sol`. You can get started by creating a file for the contract:

```
touch Incrementer.sol
```

Next, you can add the Solidity code to the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Incrementer {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(uint256 _initialNumber) {
        number = _initialNumber;
    }

    function increment(uint256 _value) public {
        number = number + _value;
    }

    function reset() public {
        number = 0;
    }
}
```

The `constructor` function, which runs when the contract is deployed, sets the initial value of the number variable stored on-chain (default is 0). The `increment` function adds the `_value` provided to the current number, but a transaction needs to be sent, which modifies the stored data. Lastly, the `reset` function resets the stored value to zero.

!!! note
    This contract is a simple example for illustration purposes only.

### Compile Contract Script {: #compile-contract-script }

In this section, you'll create a script that uses the Solidity compiler to output the bytecode and interface (ABI) for the `Incrementer.sol` contract. To get started, you can create a `compile.js` file by running:

```
touch compile.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `fs` and `solc` packages
2. Using the `fs.readFileSync` function, you'll read and save the file contents of `Incrementer.sol` to `source`
3. Build the `input` object for the Solidity compiler by specifying the `language`, `sources`, and `settings` to be used
4. Using the `input` object, you can compile the contract using `solc.compile`
5. Extract the compiled contract file and export it to be used in the deployment script

```js
// 1. Import packages
import fs from 'fs';
import solc from 'solc';

// 2. Get path and load contract
const source = fs.readFileSync('Incrementer.sol', 'utf8');

// 3. Create input object
const input = {
  language: 'Solidity',
  sources: {
    'Incrementer.sol': {
      content: source,
    },
  },
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      '*': {
        '*': ['*'],
      },
    },
  },
};
// 4. Compile the contract
const tempFile = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
const contractFile = tempFile.contracts['Incrementer.sol']['Incrementer'];

// 5. Export contract data
export default contractFile;
```

### Deploy Contract Script {: #deploy-contract-script }

With the script for compiling the `Incrementer.sol` contract in place, you can then use the results to send a signed transaction that deploys it. To do so, you can create a file for the deployment script called `deploy.js`:

```bash
touch deploy.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the contract file from `compile.js`
2. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
3. Define the `privateKey` for the origin account. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Save the `bytecode` and `abi` for the compiled contract
5. Create a wallet using the `privateKey` and `provider` from the previous steps. The wallet instance is used to sign transactions
6. Create a contract instance with signer using the `ethers.ContractFactory` function, providing the `abi`, `bytecode`, and `wallet` as parameters
7. Create the asynchronous `deploy` function that will be used to deploy the contract
8. Within the `deploy` function, use the `incrementer` contract instance to call `deploy` and pass in the initial value. For this example, you can set the initial value to `5`. This will send the transaction for contract deployment. To wait for a transaction receipt you can use the `deployed` method of the contract deployment transaction
9. Lastly, run the `deploy` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract file
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create account variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};

// 4. Save the bytecode and ABI
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;

// 5. Create wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// 6. Create contract instance with signer
const incrementer = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);

// 7. Create deploy function
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to deploy from account: ${wallet.address}`);

  // 8. Send tx (initial value set to 5) and wait for receipt
  const contract = await incrementer.deploy(5);
  const txReceipt = await contract.deploymentTransaction().wait();

  console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${txReceipt.contractAddress}`);
};

// 9. Call the deploy function
deploy();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import ethers and compile
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import contractFile from './compile.js';

// Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    rpc: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
    chainId: 5678, // 0x162E in hex,
  },
};

// Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
});

// Define accounts and wallet
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// Load contract info
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;

// Create contract instance with signer
const incrementer = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);

// Create deploy function
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to deploy from account: ${wallet.address}`);

  // Send tx (initial value set to 5) and wait for receipt
  const contract = await incrementer.deploy(5);
  const txReceipt = await contract.deploymentTransaction().wait();

  console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${txReceipt.contractAddress}`);
};

// Call the deploy function
deploy();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
node deploy.js
```

If successful, the contract's address will be displayed in the terminal.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node deploy.js</span>
  <span data-ty>Attempting to deploy from account: 0x44236223aB4291b93EEd10E4B511B37a398DEE55
    <br> Contract deployed at address: 0x2EF0C649C08D55637dec9fCcebCFeD27F2F2a5F2
  </span>
</div>

### Read Contract Data (Call Methods) {: #read-contract-data }

Call methods are the type of interaction that don't modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning no transaction needs to be sent. They simply read various storage variables of the deployed contract.

To get started, you can create a file and name it `get.js`:

```bash
touch get.js
```

Then you can take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `contractFile` from the `compile.js` file, where the ABI of the contract is
2. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
3. Create the `contractAddress` variable using the address of the deployed contract
4. Create an instance of the contract using the `ethers.Contract` function and passing in the `contractAddress`, `abi`, and `provider`
5. Create the asynchronous `get` function
6. Use the contract instance to call one of the contract's methods and pass in any inputs if necessary. For this example, you'll call the `number` method, which requires no inputs, and `await`, which will return the requested value once the request promise resolves
7. Lastly, call the `get` function

```js
// 1. Import the ABI
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Contract address variable
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// 4. Create contract instance
const incrementer = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractFile.abi,
  provider
);

// 5. Create get function
const get = async () => {
  console.log(`Making a call to contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // 6. Call contract 
  const data = await incrementer.number();

  console.log(`The current number stored is: ${data}`);
};

// 7. Call get function
get();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import ethers and compile
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import contractFile from './compile.js';

// Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    rpc: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
    chainId: 5678, // 0x162E in hex,
  },
};

// Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
});

// Contract address variable
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// Create contract instance
const incrementer = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractFile.abi,
  provider
);

// Create get function
const get = async () => {
  console.log(`Making a call to contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // Call contract
  const data = await incrementer.number();

  console.log(`The current number stored is: ${data}`);
};

// Call get function
get();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node get.js
```

If successful, the value will be displayed in the terminal.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node get.js</span>
  <span data-ty>Making a call to contract at address: 0x2EF0C649C08D55637dec9fCcebCFeD27F2F2a5F2
    <br> The current number stored is: 5
  </span>
</div>

### Interact with Contract (Send Methods) {: #interact-with-contract }

Send methods are the type of interaction that modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning a transaction needs to be signed and sent. In this section, you'll create two scripts: one to increment and one to reset the incrementer. To get started, you can create a file for each script and name them `increment.js` and `reset.js`:

```bash
touch increment.js reset.js
```

Open the `increment.js` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `contractFile` from the `compile.js` file, where the ABI of the contract is
2. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
3. Define the `privateKey` for the origin account, the `contractAddress` of the deployed contract, and the `_value` to increment by. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Create a wallet using the `privateKey` and `provider` from the previous steps. The wallet instance is used to sign transactions
5. Create an instance of the contract using the `ethers.Contract` function and passing in the `contractAddress`, `abi`, and `provider`
6. Create the asynchronous `increment` function
7. Use the contract instance to call one of the contract's methods and pass in any inputs if necessary. For this example, you'll call the `increment` method, providing the value to increment by as an input, and `await`, which will return the requested value once the request promise resolves
8. Lastly, call the `increment` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract ABI
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const _value = 3;

// 4. Create wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// 5. Create contract instance with signer
const incrementer = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractFile.abi,
  wallet
);

// 6. Create increment function
const increment = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the increment by ${_value} function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );

  // 7. Sign and send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await incrementer.increment(_value);
  await createReceipt.wait();

  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.hash}`);
};

// 8. Call the increment function
increment();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import ethers and compile
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import contractFile from './compile.js';

// Define network configurations
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: {
    name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
    rpc: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
    chainId: 5678, // 0x162E in hex,
  },
};

// Create ethers provider
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(providerRPC.evmNetwork.rpc, {
  chainId: providerRPC.evmNetwork.chainId,
  name: providerRPC.evmNetwork.name,
});

// Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const _value = 3;

// Create wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// Create contract instance with signer
const incrementer = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractFile.abi,
  wallet
);

// Create increment function
const increment = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the increment by ${_value} function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );

  // Sign and send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await incrementer.increment(_value);
  await createReceipt.wait();

  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.hash}`);
};

// Call the increment function
increment();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node increment.js
```

If successful, the transaction hash will be displayed in the terminal. You can use the `get.js` script alongside the `increment.js` script to make sure that the value is changing as expected:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>node increment.js</span>
  <span data-ty>Calling the increment by 3 function in contract at address: 0x2EF0C649C08D55637dec9fCcebCFe D27F2F2a5F2
    <br> Tx successful with hash: 0x8aa7ccb4613ac92713bcc6ff064f1b0c978e24b3f6acb6d6bfa730a10af522bb

    <br> The current number stored is: 8
  </span>
</div>

Next you can open the `reset.js` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `contractFile` from the `compile.js` file, where the ABI of the contract is
2. [Set up the Ethers provider](#setting-up-the-ethers-provider)
3. Define the `privateKey` for the origin account and the `contractAddress` of the deployed contract. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Create a wallet using the `privateKey` and `provider` from the previous steps. The wallet instance is used to sign transactions
5. Create an instance of the contract using the `ethers.Contract` function and passing in the `contractAddress`, `abi`, and `provider`
6. Create the asynchronous `reset` function
7. Use the contract instance to call one of the contract's methods and pass in any inputs if necessary. For this example, you will call the `reset` method which doesn't require any inputs. You can use `await` which will return the value requested once the request promise resolves
8. Lastly, call the `reset` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract ABI
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Add the Ethers provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// 4. Create wallet
let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(accountFrom.privateKey, provider);

// 5. Create contract instance with signer
const incrementer = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractFile.abi,
  wallet
);

// 6. Create reset function
const reset = async () => {
  console.log(`Calling the reset function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // 7. sign and send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await incrementer.reset();
  await createReceipt.wait();

  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.hash}`);
};

// 8. Call the reset function
reset();
```

# viem TypeScript Ethereum Library

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[viem](https://viem.sh){target=\_blank} is a modular TypeScript library that allows developers to interact with abstractions over the JSON-RPC API, making it easy to interact with Ethereum nodes. Since Tanssi-powered EVM networks have an Ethereum API available that is fully compatible with Ethereum-style JSON-RPC invocations, developers can leverage this compatibility to interact with any Tanssi EVM network. For more information on viem, check out their [documentation site](https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use viem to send a transaction and deploy a contract on the demo EVM network. This guide can be adapted for use with any Tanssi-powered EVM network.

!!! note
    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Node.js and a package manager (such as npm or yarn) installed. To learn how to install Node.js, please check their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\blank}.
    
    Also, make sure you've initialized a `package.json` file for ES6 modules. You can initialize a default `package.json` file using npm by running the following command `npm init --yes`.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

 - An account with funds in the Tanssi EVM network you are testing with

## Installing viem {: #installing-viem }

To get started, you'll need to create a basic TypeScript project. First, create a directory to store all of the files you'll be creating throughout this guide, and initialize the project with the following command:

```bash
mkdir viem-examples && cd viem-examples && npm init --y
```

For this guide, you'll need to install the viem library and the Solidity compiler. To install both packages, you can run the following command:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install typescript ts-node viem solc@0.8.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add typescript ts-node viem solc@0.8.0
    ```

You can create a TypeScript configuration file by running:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

!!! note
    This tutorial was created using Node.js v18.18.0.

## Set Up a viem Client (Provider) {: #setting-up-a-viem-provider }

Throughout this guide, you'll be creating a bunch of scripts that provide different functionality, such as sending a transaction, deploying a contract, and interacting with a deployed contract. In most of these scripts, you'll need to create a [viem client](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/){target=\_blank} to interact with the network.

You can create a viem client for reading chain data, like balances or contract data, using the `createPublicClient` function, or you can create a viem client for writing chain data, like sending transactions, using the `createWalletClient` function.

Creating a viem client to interact with your Tanssi EVM network is a two-step process. First, you'll need to import the `defineChain` function from viem. This will allow you to specify the details of your Tanssi EVM network (or any arbitrary EVM chain). You'll then need to provide all of the chain details, as shown in the next section.

### For Reading Chain Data {: #for-reading-chain-data }

To create a client for reading chain data, you can take the following steps:

1. Import the `createPublicClient`, `http`, and `defineChain`functions from `viem`
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. Create the `client` using the `createPublicClient` function and pass in the network and the HTTP RPC endpoint

```ts
// 1. Import the necessary components from viem
import { createPublicClient, http, defineChain } from 'viem';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'TANGO',
    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a public client for reading chain data
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});
```

### For Writing Chain Data {: #for-writing-chain-data }

To create a client for writing chain data, you can take the following steps:

1. Import the `createWalletClient`, `http`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, and the `privateKeyToAccount` function from `viem/accounts`
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. Create your account using the `privateKeyToAccount` function
4. Create the `client` using the `createWalletClient` function and pass in the account, network, and the HTTP RPC endpoint

!!! remember
    This is for demo purposes only. Never store your private key in a TypeScript file.



```ts
// 1. Import the necessary components from viem and viem/accounts
import { createWalletClient, http, defineChain } from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'TANGO',
    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create your account using the privateKeyToAccount function
const account = privateKeyToAccount('INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY');
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';

//4. Create a wallet client for writing chain data
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});
```

!!! note
    To interact with browser-based wallets, you can use the following code to create an account. In this snippet, `demo` refers to the demo EVM network created with `defineChain`.
    ```ts
    const [account] = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
});
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: demo,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
});
    ```

## Send a Transaction {: #send-transaction }

During this section, you'll be creating a couple of scripts. The first one will check the balances of your accounts before trying to send a transaction. The second script will send the transaction. You can also use the balance script to check the account balances after the transaction has been sent.

### Check Balances Script {: #check-balances-script }

You'll only need one file to check the balances of both addresses before and after the transaction is sent. To get started, you can create a `balances.ts` file by running:

```bash
touch balances.ts
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Update your imports to include the `createPublicClient`, `http`,`formatEther`, and `defineChain `functions from `viem` 
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data), which can be used for reading chain data, such as account balances
4. Define the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` variables
5. Create the asynchronous `balances` function that wraps the `publicClient.getBalance` method
6. Use the `publicClient.getBalance` function to fetch the balances for the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` addresses. You can also leverage the `formatEther` function to transform the balance into a more readable number (in {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} for the demo EVM network)
7. Lastly, run the `balances` function

???+ code "View balances.ts"

    ```ts
    // 1. Import the necessary components from viem
import { createPublicClient, http, formatEther, defineChain } from 'viem';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'UNIT',
    symbol: 'UNIT',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a public client for reading chain data
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 4. Create address variables
const addressFrom = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM';
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// 5. Create balances function
const balances = async () => {
  // 6. Fetch balances
  const balanceFrom = formatEther(
    await publicClient.getBalance({ address: addressFrom })
  );
  const balanceTo = formatEther(
    await publicClient.getBalance({ address: addressTo })
  );

  console.log(`The balance of ${addressFrom} is: ${balanceFrom} TANGO`);
  console.log(`The balance of ${addressTo} is: ${balanceTo} TANGO`);
};

// 7. Call the balances function
balances();
    ```

To run the script and fetch the account balances, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node balances.ts
```

If successful, the balances for the origin and receiving address will be displayed in your terminal in {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}.

![The result of running the balances script in the terminal](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/viem/viem-1.webp)

### Send Transaction Script {: #send-transaction-script }

You'll only need one file to execute a transaction between accounts. For this example, you'll be transferring 1 {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token from an origin address on the demo EVM network (from which you hold the private key) to another address. To get started, you can create a `transaction.ts` file by running:

```bash
touch transaction.ts
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Update your imports to include `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient`, `http`, `parseEther`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, as well as the `privateKeyToAccount` function from `viem/accounts`
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. [Set up a viem wallet client](#for-writing-chain-data) for writing chain data, which can be used along with your private key to send transactions. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a TypeScript file**
4. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data) for reading chain data, which will be used to wait for the transaction receipt
5. Define the `addressTo` variable
6. Create the asynchronous `send` function, which wraps the transaction object and the `walletClient.sendTransaction` method
7. Use the `walletClient.sendTransaction` function to sign and send the transaction. You'll need to pass in the transaction object, which only requires the recipient's address and the amount to send. Note that `parseEther` can be used, which handles the necessary unit conversions from Ether to Wei, similar to using `parseUnits(value, decimals)`. Use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction hash is returned
8. Use the `publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt` function to wait for the transaction receipt, signaling that the transaction has been completed. This is particularly helpful if you need the transaction receipt or if you're running the `balances.ts` script directly after this one to check if the balances have been updated as expected
9. Lastly, run the `send` function

???+ code "View transaction.ts"

    ```ts
    // 1. Import the necessary components from viem and viem/accounts
import {
  createPublicClient,
  createWalletClient,
  http,
  parseEther,
  defineChain,
} from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'TANGO',
    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a wallet client for writing chain data
// The private key must be prepended with `0x` to avoid errors
const account = privateKeyToAccount('INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY');
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 4. Create a public client for reading chain data
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 5. Create to address variable
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// 6. Create send function
const send = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Attempting to send transaction from ${account.address} to ${addressTo}`
  );

  // 7. Sign and send transaction
  const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({
    to: addressTo,
    value: parseEther('1'),
  });

  // 8. Wait for the transaction receipt
  await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash,
  });

  console.log(`Transaction successful with hash: ${hash}`);
};

// 9. Call the send function
send();
    ```

To run the script, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node transaction.ts
```

If the transaction was successful, in your terminal, you'll see the transaction hash has been printed out. You can also use the `balances.ts` script to check that the balances for the origin and receiving accounts have changed. The entire workflow would look like this:

![The result of running the transaction and balances scripts in the terminal](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/viem/viem-2.webp)

## Deploy a Contract {: #deploy-contract }

The contract you'll be compiling and deploying in the next couple of sections is a simple incrementer contract, arbitrarily named `Incrementer.sol`. You can get started by creating a file for the contract:

```
touch Incrementer.sol
```

Next, you can add the Solidity code to the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Incrementer {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(uint256 _initialNumber) {
        number = _initialNumber;
    }

    function increment(uint256 _value) public {
        number = number + _value;
    }

    function reset() public {
        number = 0;
    }
}
```

The `constructor` function, which runs when the contract is deployed, sets the initial value of the number variable stored on-chain (default is 0). The `increment` function adds the `_value` provided to the current number, but a transaction needs to be sent, which modifies the stored data. Lastly, the `reset` function resets the stored value to zero.

!!! note
    This contract is a simple example for illustration purposes only.

### Compile Contract Script {: #compile-contract-script }

In this section, you'll create a script that uses the Solidity compiler to output the bytecode and interface (ABI) for the `Incrementer.sol` contract. To get started, you can create a `compile.ts` file by running:

```bash
touch compile.ts
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `fs` and `solc` packages
2. Using the `fs.readFileSync` function, you'll read and save the file contents of `Incrementer.sol` to `source`
3. Build the `input` object for the Solidity compiler by specifying the `language`, `sources`, and `settings` to be used
4. Using the `input` object, you can compile the contract using `solc.compile`
5. Extract the compiled contract file and export it to be used in the deployment script

```js
// 1. Import packages
const fs = require('fs');
const solc = require('solc');

// 2. Get path and load contract
const source = fs.readFileSync('Incrementer.sol', 'utf8');

// 3. Create input object
const input = {
  language: 'Solidity',
  sources: {
    'Incrementer.sol': {
      content: source,
    },
  },
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      '*': {
        '*': ['*'],
      },
    },
  },
};
// 4. Compile the contract
const tempFile = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
const contractFile = tempFile.contracts['Incrementer.sol']['Incrementer'];

// 5. Export contract data
export default contractFile;
```

### Deploy Contract Script {: #deploy-contract-script }

With the script for compiling the `Incrementer.sol` contract in place, you can then use the results to send a signed transaction that deploys it. To do so, you can create a file for the deployment script called `deploy.ts`:

```bash
touch deploy.ts
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Update your imports to include the `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient`, `http`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, the `privateKeyToAccount` function from `viem/accounts`, and the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file you created in the [Compile Contract Script](#compile-contract-script) section
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. [Set up a viem wallet client](#for-writing-chain-data) for writing chain data, which will be used along with your private key to deploy the `Incrementer` contract. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a TypeScript file**
4. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data) for reading chain data, which will be used to read the transaction receipt for the deployment
5. Load the contract `bytecode` and `abi` for the compiled contract
6. Create the asynchronous `deploy` function that will be used to deploy the contract via the `walletClient.deployContract` method
7. Use the `walletClient.deployContract` function to sign and send the transaction. You'll need to pass in the contract's ABI and bytecode, the account to deploy the transaction from, and the initial value for the incrementer. Use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction hash is returned
8. Use the `publicClient.readContract` function to get the transaction receipt for the deployment. Use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the contract address is returned
9. Lastly, run the `deploy` function

???+ code "View deploy.ts"

    ```ts
    // 1. Update import
import {
  createPublicClient,
  createWalletClient,
  http,
  defineChain,
} from 'viem';
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'TANGO',
    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a wallet client for writing chain data
// The private key must be prepended with `0x` to avoid errors
const account = privateKeyToAccount('INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY');
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 4. Create a public client for reading chain data
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 5. Load contract information
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;
const _initialNumber = 5;

// 6. Create deploy function
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to deploy from account: ${account.address}`);

  // 7. Send transaction (initial value set to 5)
  const contract = await walletClient.deployContract({
    abi,
    account,
    bytecode,
    args: [_initialNumber],
  });

  // 8. Get the transaction receipt for the deployment
  const transaction = await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash: contract,
  });

  console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${transaction.contractAddress}`);
};

// 9. Call the deploy function
deploy();
    ```


To run the script, you can enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node deploy.ts
```

If successful, the contract's address will be displayed in the terminal.

![The result of running the deploy script in the terminal](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/viem/viem-3.webp)

### Read Contract Data (Call Methods) {: #read-contract-data }

Call methods are the type of interaction that doesn't modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning no transaction needs to be sent. They simply read various storage variables of the deployed contract.

To get started, you can create a file and name it `get.ts`:

```bash
touch get.ts
```

Then you can take the following steps to create the script:

1. Update your imports to include the `createPublicClient`, `http`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, and the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file you created in the [Compile Contract Script](#compile-contract-script) section
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data) for reading chain data, which will be used to read the current number of the `Incrementer` contract
4. Create the `contractAddress` variable using the address of the deployed contract and the `abi` variable using the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file
5. Create the asynchronous `get` function
6. Call the contract using the `publicClient.readContract` function, passing in the `abi`, the name of the function, the `contractAddress`, and any arguments (if needed). You can use `await`, which will return the value requested once the request promise resolves
7. Lastly, call the `get` function

???+ code "View get.ts"

    ```ts
    // 1. Update import
import { createPublicClient, http, defineChain } from 'viem';
import contractFile from './compile';

// 2. Specify the details of your EVM network
export const demoEVM = defineChain({
  id: 5678,
  name: 'demo',
  network: 'demo',
  nativeCurrency: {
    decimals: 18,
    name: 'TANGO',
    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a public client for reading chain data
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});
// 4. Create contract variables
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const abi = contractFile.abi;

// 5. Create get function
const get = async () => {
  console.log(`Making a call to contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // 6. Call contract
  const data = await publicClient.readContract({
    abi,
    functionName: 'number',
    address: contractAddress,
    args: [],
  });

  console.log(`The current number stored is: ${data}`);
};

// 7. Call get function
get();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node get.ts
```

If successful, the value will be displayed in the terminal.

![The result of running the get script in the terminal](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/viem/viem-4.webp)

### Interact with Contract (Send Methods) {: #interact-with-contract }

Send methods are the type of interactions that modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning a transaction needs to be signed and sent. In this section, you'll create two scripts: one to increment and one to reset the incrementer. To get started, you can create a file for each script and name them `increment.ts` and `reset.ts`:

```bash
touch increment.ts reset.ts
```

Open the `increment.ts` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Update your imports to include the `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient` `http`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, the  `privateKeyToAccount` from `viem/accounts'` and the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file you created in the [Compile Contract Script](#compile-contract-script) section
2. Define the chain details of your Tanssi EVM network, making sure to include all fields shown below. Both `public` and `default` RPC URLs are required to be listed, even if they are the same
3. [Set up a viem wallet client](#for-writing-chain-data) for writing chain data, which will be used along with your private key to send a transaction. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a TypeScript file**
4. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data) for reading chain data, which will be used to wait for the transaction receipt
5. Create the `contractAddress` variable using the address of the deployed contract, the `abi` variable using the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file, and the `_value` to increment the contract by
6. Create the asynchronous `increment` function
7. Call the contract using the `walletClient.writeContract` function, passing in the `abi`, the name of the function, the `contractAddress`, and the `_value`. You can use `await`, which will return the transaction hash once the request promise resolves
8. Use the `publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt` function to wait for the transaction receipt, signaling that the transaction has been completed. This is particularly helpful if you need the transaction receipt or if you're running the `get.ts` script directly after this one to check that the current number has been updated as expected
9. Lastly, call the `increment` function

    symbol: 'TANGO',
  },
  rpcUrls: {

      webSocket: ['wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'],
    },
    public: {

  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: 'Explorer',
      url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/',
    },
  },
});

// 3. Create a wallet client for writing chain data
// The private key must be prepended with `0x` to avoid errors
const account = privateKeyToAccount('INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY');
const rpcUrl = 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001';
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 4. Create a public client for reading chain data
const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: demoEVM,
  transport: http(rpcUrl),
});

// 5. Create contract variables
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const abi = contractFile.abi;
const _value = 3;

// 6. Create increment function
const increment = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the increment by ${_value} function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );
  // 7. Call contract
  const hash = await walletClient.writeContract({
    abi,
    functionName: 'increment',
    address: contractAddress,
    args: [_value],
  });

  // 8. Wait for the transaction receipt
  await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash,
  });

  console.log(`Transaction successful with hash: ${hash}`);
};

// 9. Call increment function
increment();
    ```


To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ts-node increment.ts
```

If successful, the transaction hash will be displayed in the terminal. You can use the `get.ts` script alongside the `increment.ts` script to make sure that value is changing as expected.

![The result of running the increment and get scripts in the terminal](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/viem/viem-5.webp)

Next, you can open the `reset.ts` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Update your imports to include the `createPublicClient`, `createWalletClient` `http`, and `defineChain` functions from `viem`, the  `privateKeyToAccount` from `viem/accounts'` and the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file you created in the [Compile Contract Script](#compile-contract-script) section

4. [Set up a public viem client](#for-reading-chain-data) for reading chain data, which will be used to wait for the transaction receipt
5. Create the `contractAddress` variable using the address of the deployed contract and the `abi` variable using the `contractFile` from the `compile.ts` file to increment the contract by
6. Create the asynchronous `reset` function
7. Call the contract using the `walletClient.writeContract` function, passing in the `abi`, the name of the function, the `contractAddress`, and an empty array for the arguments. You can use `await`, which will return the transaction hash once the request promise resolves
8. Use the `publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt` function to wait for the transaction receipt, signaling that the transaction has been completed. This is particularly helpful if you need the transaction receipt or if you're running the `get.ts` script directly after this one to check that the current number has been reset to `0`
9. Lastly, call the `reset` function

# Web3.js JavaScript Library

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io){target=\_blank} is a set of libraries that allow developers to interact with Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket protocols with JavaScript. Tanssi-powered EVM networks have an Ethereum-like API that is fully compatible with Ethereum-style JSON RPC invocations. Therefore, developers can leverage this compatibility and use the Web3.js library to interact with a Tanssi EVM network node as if they were doing so on Ethereum. For more information on Web3.js, check out their [documentation site](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set up the Web3.js library for your Tanssi EVM network. Next, to showcase the library in action, you'll use the Web3.js library to send a transaction and deploy a contract on a Tanssi demo EVM network running on [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi EVM network by simply changing the endpoint.

!!! note
    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Node.js and a package manager (such as npm or yarn) installed. To learn how to install Node.js, please check their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\blank}.
    
    Also, make sure you've initialized a `package.json` file for ES6 modules. You can initialize a default `package.json` file using npm by running the following command `npm init --yes`.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

- An account with funds in the Tanssi EVM network you are testing with

## Installing Web3Js {: #installing-web3js }

For this guide, you'll need to install the Web3.js library and the Solidity compiler. To install both NPM packages, you can run the following command:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install web3 solc@0.8.0
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add web3 solc@0.8.0
    ```

## Setting up the Web3 Provider {: #setting-up-the-web3-provider }

Throughout this guide, you'll be creating a bunch of scripts that provide different functionality such as sending a transaction, deploying a contract, and interacting with a deployed contract. In most of these scripts you'll need to create an Web3.js provider to interact with the network.

To set up a Web3 provider, you can take the following steps:

1. Import the `Web3` library.
2. Create the Web3 provider and specify the RPC url. You can configure Web3.js to work with the Tanssi demo EVM network running on Dancelight, or your own Tanssi EVM network by simply changing the endpoint.

```js
// 1. Import Web3
const Web3 = require('web3');

// 2. Create Web3 provider and insert your RPC url
const web3 = new Web3(
  '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}'
);
```

Save this code snippet as you'll need it for the scripts that are used in the following sections.

## Send a Transaction {: #send-a-transaction }

During this section, you'll be creating a couple of scripts. The first one will be to check the balances of your accounts before trying to send a transaction. The second script will actually send the transaction.

You can also use the balance script to check the account balances after the transaction has been sent.

### Check Balances Script {: #check-balances-script }

You'll only need one file to check the balances of both addresses before and after the transaction is sent. To get started, you can create a `balances.js` file by running:

```bash
touch balances.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
2. Define the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` variables
3. Create the asynchronous `balances` function which wraps the `web3.eth.getBalance` method
4. Use the `web3.eth.getBalance` function to fetch the balances for the `addressFrom` and `addressTo` addresses. You can also leverage the `web3.utils.fromWei` function to transform the balance into a more readable number in `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`
5. Lastly, run the `balances` function

```js
// 1. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 2. Create address variables
const addressFrom = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM';
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// 3. Create balances function
const balances = async () => {
  // 4. Fetch balance info
  const balanceFrom = web3.utils.fromWei(
    await web3.eth.getBalance(addressFrom),
    'ether'
  );
  const balanceTo = web3.utils.fromWei(
    await web3.eth.getBalance(addressTo),
    'ether'
  );

  console.log(`The balance of ${addressFrom} is: ${balanceFrom} {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`);
  console.log(`The balance of ${addressTo} is: ${balanceTo} {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`);
};

// 5. Call balances function
balances();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import Web3
const Web3 = require('web3');

// Add the Web3 provider logic here:
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
};
const web3 = new Web3(providerRPC.evmNetwork);

// Create address variables
const addressFrom = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM';
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// Create balances function
const balances = async () => {
  // Fetch balance info
  const balanceFrom = web3.utils.fromWei(
    await web3.eth.getBalance(addressFrom),
    'ether'
  );
  const balanceTo = web3.utils.fromWei(
    await web3.eth.getBalance(addressTo),
    'ether'
  );

  console.log(`The balance of ${addressFrom} is: ${balanceFrom} TANGO`);
  console.log(`The balance of ${addressTo} is: ${balanceTo} TANGO`);
};

// Call balances function
balances();
    ```

To run the script and fetch the account balances, you can run the following command:

```bash
node balances.js
```

If successful, the balances for the origin and receiving address will be displayed in your terminal in ETH.

### Send Transaction Script {: #send-transaction-script }

You'll only need one file to execute a transaction between accounts. For this example, you'll be transferring 1 {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token from an origin address (from which you hold the private key) to another address. To get started, you can create a `transaction.js` file by running:

```bash
touch transaction.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
2. Define the `addressFrom`, including the `privateKey`, and the `addressTo` variables. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
3. Create the asynchronous `send` function, which wraps the transaction object, and the sign and send transaction functions
4. Create and sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction` function. Pass in the `gas`, `addressTo`, and `value` for the transaction along with the sender's `privateKey`
5. Send the signed transaction using the `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` method and pass in the raw transaction. Then use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction receipt is returned
6. Lastly, run the `send` function

```js
// 1. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 2. Create account variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  address: 'INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK',
};
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO'; // Change to address

// 3. Create send function
const send = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Attempting to send transaction from ${accountFrom.address} to ${addressTo}`
  );

  // 4. Sign tx with PK
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      gas: 21000,
      to: addressTo,
      value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // 5. Send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(
    `Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`
  );
};

// 6. Call send function
send();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import Web3
const Web3 = require('web3');

// Add the Web3 provider logic here:
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
};
const web3 = new Web3(providerRPC.evmNetwork);

// Create account variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  address: 'INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK',
};
const addressTo = 'INSERT_ADDRESS_TO';

// Create send function
const send = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Attempting to send transaction from ${accountFrom.address} to ${addressTo}`
  );

  // Sign tx with PK
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      gas: 21000,
      to: addressTo,
      value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // Send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(
    `Transaction successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`
  );
};

// Call send function
send();
    ```

To run the script, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node transaction.js
```

If the transaction was successful, in your terminal, you'll see the transaction hash has been printed out.

You can also use the `balances.js` script to check that the balances for the origin and receiving accounts have changed. The entire workflow would look like this:

![Send Tx Web3js](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/web3js-2.webp)

## Deploy a Contract {: #deploy-a-contract }

The contract you'll be compiling and deploying in the next couple of sections is a simple incrementer contract, arbitrarily named `Incrementer.sol`. You can get started by creating a file for the contract:

```
touch Incrementer.sol
```

Next, you can add the Solidity code to the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Incrementer {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(uint256 _initialNumber) {
        number = _initialNumber;
    }

    function increment(uint256 _value) public {
        number = number + _value;
    }

    function reset() public {
        number = 0;
    }
}
```

The `constructor` function, which runs when the contract is deployed, sets the initial value of the number variable stored on-chain (default is 0). The `increment` function adds the `_value` provided to the current number, but a transaction needs to be sent, which modifies the stored data. Lastly, the `reset` function resets the stored value to zero.

!!! note
    This contract is a simple example for illustration purposes only.

### Compile Contract Script {: #compile-contract-script }

In this section, you'll create a script that uses the Solidity compiler to output the bytecode and interface (ABI) for the `Incrementer.sol` contract. To get started, you can create a `compile.js` file by running:

```
touch compile.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `fs` and `solc` packages
2. Using the `fs.readFileSync` function, you'll read and save the file contents of `Incrementer.sol` to `source`
3. Build the `input` object for the Solidity compiler by specifying the `language`, `sources`, and `settings` to be used
4. Using the `input` object, you can compile the contract using `solc.compile`
5. Extract the compiled contract file and export it to be used in the deployment script

```js
// 1. Import packages
import fs from 'fs';
import solc from 'solc';

// 2. Get path and load contract
const source = fs.readFileSync('Incrementer.sol', 'utf8');

// 3. Create input object
const input = {
  language: 'Solidity',
  sources: {
    'Incrementer.sol': {
      content: source,
    },
  },
  settings: {
    outputSelection: {
      '*': {
        '*': ['*'],
      },
    },
  },
};
// 4. Compile the contract
const tempFile = JSON.parse(solc.compile(JSON.stringify(input)));
const contractFile = tempFile.contracts['Incrementer.sol']['Incrementer'];

// 5. Export contract data
export default contractFile;
```

### Deploy Contract Script {: #deploy-contract-script }

With the script for compiling the `Incrementer.sol` contract in place, you can then use the results to send a signed transaction that deploys it. To do so, you can create a file for the deployment script called `deploy.js`:

```bash
touch deploy.js
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the contract file from `compile.js`
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
3. Define the `addressFrom`, including the `privateKey`, and the `addressTo` variables. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Save the `bytecode` and `abi` for the compiled contract
5. Create the asynchronous `deploy` function that will be used to deploy the contract
6. Create the contract instance using the `web3.eth.Contract` function
7. Create the constructor and pass in the `bytecode` and the initial value for the incrementer. For this example, you can set the initial value to `5`
8. Create and sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction` function. Pass in the `data` and the `gas` for the transaction along with the sender's `privateKey`
9. Send the signed transaction using the `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` method and pass in the raw transaction. Then use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction receipt is returned
10. Lastly, run the `deploy` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract file
const contractFile = require('./compile');

// 2. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create address variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY',
  address: 'INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK',
};

// 4. Get the bytecode and API
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;

// 5. Create deploy function
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to deploy from account ${accountFrom.address}`);

  // 6. Create contract instance
  const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);

  // 7. Create constructor tx
  const incrementerTx = incrementer.deploy({
    data: bytecode,
    arguments: [5],
  });

  // 8. Sign transacation and send
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      data: incrementerTx.encodeABI(),
      gas: await incrementerTx.estimateGas(),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // 9. Send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${createReceipt.contractAddress}`);
};

// 10. Call deploy function
deploy();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import web3 and the contract file
const Web3 = require('web3');
const contractFile = require('./compile');

// Add the Web3 provider logic here
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
};
const web3 = new Web3(providerRPC.evmNetwork);

// Create address variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY',
  address: 'INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK',
};

// Get the bytecode and API
const bytecode = contractFile.evm.bytecode.object;
const abi = contractFile.abi;

// Create deploy function
const deploy = async () => {
  console.log(`Attempting to deploy from account ${accountFrom.address}`);

  // Create contract instance
  const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);

  // Create constructor tx with initial value of 5
  const incrementerTx = incrementer.deploy({
    data: bytecode,
    arguments: [5],
  });

  // Sign transacation and send
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      data: incrementerTx.encodeABI(),
      gas: await incrementerTx.estimateGas(),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // Send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${createReceipt.contractAddress}`);
};

// Call deploy function
deploy();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
node deploy.js
```

If successful, the contract's address will be displayed in the terminal.

### Read Contract Data (Call Methods) {: #read-contract-data }

Call methods are the type of interactions that don't modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning no transaction needs to be sent. They simply read various storage variables of the deployed contract.

To get started, you can create a file and name it `get.js`:

```bash
touch get.js
```

Then you can take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `abi` from the `compile.js` file
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
3. Create the `contractAddress` variable using the address of the deployed contract
4. Create an instance of the contract using the `web3.eth.Contract` function and passing in the `abi` and `contractAddress`
5. Create the asynchronous `get` function
6. Use the contract instance to call one of the contract's methods and pass in any inputs if necessary. For this example, you will call the `number` method, which doesn't require any inputs. You can use `await`, which will return the value requested once the request promise resolves
7. Lastly, call the `get` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract abi
const { abi } = require('./compile');

// 2. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create address variables
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// 4. Create contract instance
const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// 5. Create get function
const get = async () => {
  console.log(`Making a call to contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // 6. Call contract
  const data = await incrementer.methods.number().call();

  console.log(`The current number stored is: ${data}`);
};

// 7. Call get function
get();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import web3 and the contract file
const Web3 = require('web3');
const { abi } = require('./compile');

// Add the Web3 provider logic here:
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
};
const web3 = new Web3(providerRPC.evmNetwork);

// Create address variables
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// Create contract instance
const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Create get function
const get = async () => {
  console.log(`Making a call to contract at address: ${contractAddress}`);

  // Call contract
  const data = await incrementer.methods.number().call();

  console.log(`The current number stored is: ${data}`);
};

// Call get function
get();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node get.js
```

If successful, the value will be displayed in the terminal.

### Interact with Contract (Send Methods) {: #interact-with-contract }

Send methods are the type of interactions that modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning a transaction needs to be signed and sent. In this section, you'll create two scripts: one to increment and one to reset the incrementer. To get started, you can create a file for each script and name them `increment.js` and `reset.js`:

```bash
touch increment.js reset.js
```

Open the `increment.js` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `abi` from the `compile.js` file
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
3. Define the `privateKey` for the origin account, the `contractAddress` of the deployed contract, and the `_value` to increment by. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Create an instance of the contract using the `web3.eth.Contract` function and passing in the `abi` and `contractAddress`
5. Use the contract instance to build the increment transaction using the `methods.increment` function and passing in the `_value` as an input
6. Create the asynchronous `increment` function
7. Use the contract instance and the increment transaction you previously created to sign the transaction with the sender's private key. You'll use the `web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction` function and specify the `to` address, the `data`, and the `gas` for the transaction
8. Send the signed transaction using the `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` method and pass in the raw transaction. Then use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction receipt is returned
9. Lastly, call the `increment` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract abi
const { abi } = require('./compile');

// 2. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const _value = 3;

// 4. Create contract instance
const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// 5. Build increment tx
const incrementTx = incrementer.methods.increment(_value);

// 6. Create increment function
const increment = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the increment by ${_value} function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );

  // 7. Sign Tx with PK
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      to: contractAddress,
      data: incrementTx.encodeABI(),
      gas: await incrementTx.estimateGas(),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // 8. Send Tx and Wait for Receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`);
};

// 9. Call increment function
increment();
```

??? code "View the complete script"

    ```js
    // Import Web3 and the contract abi
const Web3 = require('web3');
const { abi } = require('./compile');

// Add the Web3 provider logic here:
const providerRPC = {
  evmNetwork: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001', // Insert your RPC URL here
};
const web3 = new Web3(providerRPC.evmNetwork);

// Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const _value = 3;

// Create contract instance
const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// Build increment tx
const incrementTx = incrementer.methods.increment(_value);

// Create increment function
const increment = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the increment by ${_value} function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );

  // Sign Tx with PK
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      to: contractAddress,
      data: incrementTx.encodeABI(),
      gas: await incrementTx.estimateGas(),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // Send Tx and Wait for Receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`);
};

// Call increment function
increment();
    ```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node increment.js
```

If successful, the transaction hash will be displayed in the terminal. You can use the `get.js` script alongside the `increment.js` script to make sure that the value is changing as expected.

![Increment and check value Web3js](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/web3js-5.webp)

Next you can open the `reset.js` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Import the `abi` from the `compile.js` file
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3-provider)
3. Define the `privateKey` for the origin account and the `contractAddress` of the deployed contract. The private key is required to create a wallet instance. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
4. Create an instance of the contract using the `web3.eth.Contract` function and passing in the `abi` and `contractAddress`
5. Use the contract instance to build the reset transaction using the `methods.reset` function
6. Create the asynchronous `reset` function
7. Use the contract instance and the reset transaction you previously created to sign the transaction with the sender's private key. You'll use the `web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction` function and specify the `to` address, the `data`, and the `gas` for the transaction
8. Send the signed transaction using the `web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction` method and pass in the raw transaction. Then use `await` to wait until the transaction is processed and the transaction receipt is returned
9. Lastly, call the `reset` function

```js
// 1. Import the contract abi
const { abi } = require('./compile');

// 2. Add the Web3 provider logic here:
// {...}

// 3. Create variables
const accountFrom = {
  privateKey: 'INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
};
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';

// 4. Create Contract Instance
const incrementer = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

// 5. Build reset tx
const resetTx = incrementer.methods.reset();

// 6. Create reset function
const reset = async () => {
  console.log(
    `Calling the reset function in contract at address: ${contractAddress}`
  );

  // 7. Sign tx with PK
  const createTransaction = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(
    {
      to: contractAddress,
      data: resetTx.encodeABI(),
      gas: await resetTx.estimateGas(),
    },
    accountFrom.privateKey
  );

  // 8. Send tx and wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(
    createTransaction.rawTransaction
  );
  console.log(`Tx successful with hash: ${createReceipt.transactionHash}`);
};

// 9. Call reset function
reset();
```

# Web3.py Python Library

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){target=\_blank} is a set of libraries that allow developers to interact with Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket protocols with Python. Tanssi EVM networks have an Ethereum-like API available that is fully compatible with Ethereum-style JSON RPC invocations. Therefore, developers can leverage this compatibility and use the Ethers.js library to interact with a Tanssi EVM network node as if they were doing so on Ethereum. For more information on Web3.py, check their [documentation site](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, you'll learn how to use setup the Web3.py library for your Tanssi-powered EVM network. Next, to showcase the library in action, you'll use Web3.py to send a transaction and deploy a contract on a Tanssi demo EVM appchain running on [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi EVM appchain by simply changing the endpoint.

!!! note
    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Python3 and a package manager like pip installed.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

 - An account with funds in the Tanssi EVM network you are testing with

## Installing Web3.py {: #install-web3py }

For this guide, you'll need to install the Web3.py library and the Solidity compiler. To install both packages, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip3 install web3 py-solc-x
```

## Setting up the Web3.py Provider {: #setting-up-the-web3py-provider }

Throughout this guide, you'll be creating a bunch of scripts that provide different functionality such as sending a transaction, deploying a contract, and interacting with a deployed contract. In most of these scripts you'll need to create an [Web3.py provider](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html){target=\_blank} to interact with the network.

To create a provider, you can take the following steps:

1. Import the `web3` library
2. Create the `web3` provider suing using the `Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider()))` method and providing the Tanssi EVM network URL

```python
# 1. Import web3.py
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
# Insert your RPC URL here
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}')) 
```

Save this code snippet, as you'll need it for the scripts that are used in the following sections.

## Send a Transaction {: #send-a-transaction }

During this section, you'll be creating a couple of scripts. The first one will be to check the balances of your accounts before trying to send a transaction. The second script will actually send the transaction.

You can also use the balance script to check the account balances after the transaction has been sent.

### Check Balances Script {: #check-balances-script }

You'll only need one file to check the balances of both addresses before and after the transaction is sent.  To get started, you can create a `balances.py` file by running:

``` bash
touch balances.py
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
2. Define the `address_from` and `address_to` variables
3. Get the balance for the accounts using the `web3.eth.get_balance` function and format the results using the `web3.from_wei`

```python
# 1. Import web3.py
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 2. Create address variables
address_from = "INSERT_ADDRESS_FROM"
address_to = "INSERT_ADDRESS_TO"

# 4. Fetch balance data
balance_from = web3.from_wei(
    web3.eth.get_balance(Web3.to_checksum_address(address_from)), "ether"
)
balance_to = web3.from_wei(
    web3.eth.get_balance(Web3.to_checksum_address(address_to)), "ether"
)

print(f"The balance of { address_from } is: { balance_from } TANGO")
print(f"The balance of { address_to } is: { balance_to } TANGO")
```

To run the script and fetch the account balances, you can run the following command:

```bash
python3 balances.py
```

If successful, the balances for the origin and receiving address will be displayed in your terminal in {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}.

![Check Balance Ethers.js](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/web3py-1.webp)


### Send Transaction Script {: #send-transaction-script }

You'll only need one file for executing a transaction between accounts. For this example, you'll be transferring 1 DEV token from an origin address (from which you hold the private key) to another address. To get started, you can create a `transaction.py` file by running:

```bash
touch transaction.py
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Add imports, including Web3.py and the `rpc_gas_price_strategy`, which will be used in the following steps to get the gas price used for the transaction
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
3. Define the `account_from`, including the `private_key`, and the `address_to` variables. The private key is required to sign the transaction. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a Python file**
4. Use the [Web3.py Gas Price API](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gas_price.html){target=\_blank} to set a gas price strategy. For this example, you'll use the imported `rpc_gas_price_strategy`
5. Create and sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.account.sign_transaction` function. Pass in the `nonce` `gas`, `gasPrice`, `to`, and `value` for the transaction along with the sender's `private_key`. To get the `nonce` you can use the `web3.eth.get_transaction_count` function and pass in the sender's address. To predetermine the `gasPrice` you'll use the `web3.eth.generate_gas_price` function. For the `value`, you can format the amount to send from an easily readable format to Wei using the `web3.to_wei` function
6. Using the signed transaction, you can then send it using the `web3.eth.send_raw_transaction` function and wait for the transaction receipt by using the `web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt` function

```python
# 1. Add imports
from web3 import Web3
from web3.gas_strategies.rpc import rpc_gas_price_strategy

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 3. Create address variables
account_from = {
    "private_key": "INSERT_ YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "address": "INSERT_ PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK",
}
address_to = "INSERT_ ADDRESS_TO"

print(
    f'Attempting to send transaction from { account_from["address"] } to { address_to }'
)

# 4. Set the gas price strategy
web3.eth.set_gas_price_strategy(rpc_gas_price_strategy)

# 5. Sign tx with PK
tx_create = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(
    {
        "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(
            Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"])
        ),
        "gasPrice": web3.eth.generate_gas_price(),
        "gas": 21000,
        "to": Web3.to_checksum_address(address_to),
        "value": web3.to_wei("1", "ether"),
    },
    account_from["private_key"],
)

# 6. Send tx and wait for receipt
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(tx_create.rawTransaction)
tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

print(f"Transaction successful with hash: { tx_receipt.transactionHash.hex() }")
```

To run the script, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 transaction.py
```

 If the transaction was successful, in your terminal you'll see the transaction hash has been printed out.

You can also use the `balances.py` script to check that the balances for the origin and receiving accounts have changed. The entire workflow would look like this:

![Send Tx Web3.py](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/web3py-2.webp)

## Deploy a Contract {: #deploy-a-contract }

The contract you'll be compiling and deploying in the next couple of sections is a simple incrementer contract, arbitrarily named `Incrementer.sol`. You can get started by creating a file for the contract:

```
touch Incrementer.sol
```

Next, you can add the Solidity code to the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Incrementer {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(uint256 _initialNumber) {
        number = _initialNumber;
    }

    function increment(uint256 _value) public {
        number = number + _value;
    }

    function reset() public {
        number = 0;
    }
}
```

The `constructor` function, which runs when the contract is deployed, sets the initial value of the number variable stored on-chain (default is 0). The `increment` function adds the `_value` provided to the current number, but a transaction needs to be sent, which modifies the stored data. Lastly, the `reset` function resets the stored value to zero.

!!! note
    This contract is a simple example for illustration purposes only.

### Compile Contract Script {: #compile-contract-script }

In this section, you'll create a script that uses the Solidity compiler to output the bytecode and interface (ABI) for the `Incrementer.sol` contract. To get started, you can create a `compile.py` file by running:

```bash
touch compile.py
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Import the `solcx` package
2. **Optional** - If you haven't already installed the Solidity compiler, you can do so with by using the `solcx.install_solc` function
3. Compile the `Incrementer.sol` function using the `solcx.compile_files` function
4. Export the contract's ABI and bytecode

```python
# 1. Import solcx
import solcx

# 2. If you haven't already installed the Solidity compiler, uncomment the following line
# solcx.install_solc()

# 3. Compile contract
temp_file = solcx.compile_files(
    "Incrementer.sol",
    output_values=["abi", "bin"],
    # solc_version='0.8.19'
)

# 4. Export contract data
abi = temp_file["Incrementer.sol:Incrementer"]["abi"]
bytecode = temp_file["Incrementer.sol:Incrementer"]["bin"]
```

!!! note
    If you see an error stating that `Solc is not installed`, uncomment the step 2 described in the code snippet.

### Deploy Contract Script {: #deploy-contract-script }

With the script for compiling the `Incrementer.sol` contract in place, you can then use the results to send a signed transaction that deploys it. To do so, you can create a file for the deployment script called `deploy.py`:

```bash
touch deploy.py
```

Next, you will create the script for this file and complete the following steps:

1. Add imports, including Web3.py and the ABI and bytecode of the `Incrementer.sol` contract
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
3. Define the `account_from`, including the `private_key`. The private key is required to sign the transaction. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a Python file**
4. Create a contract instance using the `web3.eth.contract` function and passing in the ABI and bytecode of the contract
5. Build a constructor transaction using the contract instance and passing in the value to increment by. For this example, you can use `5`. You'll then use the `build_transaction` function to pass in the transaction information including the `from` address and the `nonce` for the sender. To get the `nonce` you can use the `web3.eth.get_transaction_count` function
6. Sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.account.sign_transaction` function and pass in the constructor transaction and the `private_key` of the sender
7. Using the signed transaction, you can then send it using the `web3.eth.send_raw_transaction` function and wait for the transaction receipt by using the `web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt` function

```python
# 1. Add imports
from compile import abi, bytecode
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 3. Create address variable
account_from = {
    "private_key": "INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "address": "INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK",
}

print(f'Attempting to deploy from account: { account_from["address"] }')

# 4. Create contract instance
Incrementer = web3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=bytecode)

# 5. Build constructor tx
construct_txn = Incrementer.constructor(5).build_transaction(
    {
        "from": Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"]),
        "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(
            Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"])
        ),
    }
)

# 6. Sign tx with PK
tx_create = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(
    construct_txn, account_from["private_key"]
)

# 7. Send tx and wait for receipt
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(tx_create.rawTransaction)
tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

print(f"Contract deployed at address: { tx_receipt.contractAddress }")
```

To run the script, you can enter the following command into your terminal:

```bash
python3 deploy.py
```

If successful, the contract's address will be displayed in the terminal.

![Deploy Contract Web3py](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/web3py-3.webp)

### Read Contract Data (Call Methods) {: #read-contract-data }

Call methods are the type of interaction that don't modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning no transaction needs to be sent. They simply read various storage variables of the deployed contract.

To get started, you can create a file and name it `get.py`:

```bash
touch get.py
```

Then you can take the following steps to create the script:

1. Add imports, including Web3.py and the ABI of the `Incrementer.sol` contract
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
3. Define the `contract_address` of the deployed contract
4. Create a contract instance using the `web3.eth.contract` function and passing in the ABI and address of the deployed contract
5. Using the contract instance, you can then call the `number` function

```python
# 1. Import the ABI
from compile import abi
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 3. Create address variable
contract_address = "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

print(f"Making a call to contract at address: { contract_address }")

# 4. Create contract instance
Incrementer = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

# 5. Call Contract
number = Incrementer.functions.number().call()
print(f"The current number stored is: { number } ")
```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 get.py
```

If successful, the value will be displayed in the terminal.

![Read from Contract Web3py](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/web3py-4.webp)

### Interact with Contract (Send Methods) {: #interact-with-contract }

Send methods are the type of interaction that modify the contract's storage (change variables), meaning a transaction needs to be signed and sent. In this section, you'll create two scripts: one to increment and one to reset the incrementer. To get started, you can create a file for each script and name them `increment.py` and `reset.py`:

```bash
touch increment.py reset.py
```

Open the `increment.py` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Add imports, including Web3.py and the ABI of the `Incrementer.sol` contract
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
3. Define the `account_from`, including the `private_key`, the `contract_address` of the deployed contract, and the `value` to increment by. The private key is required to sign the transaction. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a Python file**
4. Create a contract instance using the `web3.eth.contract` function and passing in the ABI and address of the deployed contract
5. Build the increment transaction using the contract instance and passing in the value to increment by. You'll then use the `build_transaction` function to pass in the transaction information including the `from` address and the `nonce` for the sender. To get the `nonce` you can use the `web3.eth.get_transaction_count` function
6. Sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.account.sign_transaction` function and pass in the increment transaction and the `private_key` of the sender
7. Using the signed transaction, you can then send it using the `web3.eth.send_raw_transaction` function and wait for the transaction receipt by using the `web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt` function

```python
# 1. Add imports
from compile import abi
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 3. Create variables
account_from = {
    "private_key": "INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "address": "INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK",
}
contract_address = "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
value = 3

print(
    f"Calling the increment by { value } function in contract at address: { contract_address }"
)

# 4. Create contract instance
Incrementer = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

# 5. Build increment tx
increment_tx = Incrementer.functions.increment(value).build_transaction(
    {
        "from": Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"]),
        "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(
            Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"])
        ),
    }
)

# 6. Sign tx with PK
tx_create = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(increment_tx, account_from["private_key"])

# 7. Send tx and wait for receipt
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(tx_create.rawTransaction)
tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

print(f"Tx successful with hash: { tx_receipt.transactionHash.hex() }")
```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 increment.py
```

If successful, the transaction hash will be displayed in the terminal. You can use the `get.py` script alongside the `increment.py` script to make sure that value is changing as expected:

![Increment Contract Web3py](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3py/web3py-5.webp)

Next you can open the `reset.py` file and take the following steps to create the script:

1. Add imports, including Web3.py and the ABI of the `Incrementer.sol` contract
2. [Set up the Web3 provider](#setting-up-the-web3py-provider)
3. Define the `account_from`, including the `private_key`, and the `contract_address` of the deployed contract. The private key is required to sign the transaction. **Note: This is for example purposes only. Never store your private keys in a Python file**
4. Create a contract instance using the `web3.eth.contract` function and passing in the ABI and address of the deployed contract
5. Build the reset transaction using the contract instance. You'll then use the `build_transaction` function to pass in the transaction information including the `from` address and the `nonce` for the sender. To get the `nonce` you can use the `web3.eth.get_transaction_count` function
6. Sign the transaction using the `web3.eth.account.sign_transaction` function and pass in the reset transaction and the `private_key` of the sender
7. Using the signed transaction, you can then send it using the `web3.eth.send_raw_transaction` function and wait for the transaction receipt by using the `web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt` function

```python
# 1. Add imports
from compile import abi
from web3 import Web3

# 2. Create web3.py provider
provider_rpc = {
    # Insert your RPC URL here
    "evm_network": "https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001",
}
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(provider_rpc["evm_network"]))

# 3. Create variables
account_from = {
    "private_key": "INSERT_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "address": "INSERT_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_OF_PK",
}
contract_address = "INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

print(f"Calling the reset function in contract at address: { contract_address }")

# 4. Create contract instance
Incrementer = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

# 5. Build reset tx
reset_tx = Incrementer.functions.reset().build_transaction(
    {
        "from": Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"]),
        "nonce": web3.eth.get_transaction_count(
            Web3.to_checksum_address(account_from["address"])
        ),
    }
)

# 6. Sign tx with PK
tx_create = web3.eth.account.sign_transaction(reset_tx, account_from["private_key"])

# 7. Send tx and wait for receipt
tx_hash = web3.eth.send_raw_transaction(tx_create.rawTransaction)
tx_receipt = web3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

print(f"Tx successful with hash: { tx_receipt.transactionHash.hex() }")
```

To run the script, you can enter the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 reset.py
```

If successful, the transaction hash will be displayed in the terminal. You can use the `get.py` script alongside the `reset.py` script to make sure that value is changing as expected:

# Interacting with the Batch Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Batch Precompile contract on Tanssi-powered EVM networks allows developers to combine multiple EVM calls into one.

Currently, having users interact with multiple contracts would require multiple transaction confirmations in the user's wallet. An example would be approving a smart contract's access to a token and then immediately transferring it. With the Batch Precompile, developers can enhance user experience with batched transactions as it minimizes the number of transactions a user is required to confirm. Additionally, the gas fees paid by a user can be reduced since batching avoids multiple base gas fees (the initial 21000 units of gas spent to begin a transaction).

The precompile interacts directly with [Substrate's EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier){target=\_blank}. The caller of the batch function will have their address act as the `msg.sender` for all subtransactions, but unlike [delegate calls](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries){target=\_blank}, the target contract will still affect its own storage. It is effectively the same as if the user signed multiple transactions but with only one confirmation.

The Batch Precompile is located at the following address:

```text
{{ networks.demo_evm.precompiles.batch }}
```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## The Batch Solidity Interface {: #the-batch-interface }

[`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Batch.sol){target=\_blank} is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's three methods.

    ```

The interface includes the following functions:

???+ function "**batchSome**(*address[]* to, *uint256[]* value, *bytes[]* callData, *uint64[]* gasLimit) — performs multiple calls, where the same index of each array combine into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, following subcalls will still be attempted"

    === "Parameters"

        - `to` - an array of addresses to direct subtransactions to, where each entry is a subtransaction
        - `value` - an array of native currency values to send in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all the following subtransactions will default to a value of 0

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have your wallet configured to work with your EVM network and an account funded with native tokens. You can add your EVM network to MetaMask with one click on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Or, you [configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

### Example Contract {: #example-contract}

The contract `SimpleContract.sol` will be used as an example of batching contract interactions, but in practice, any contract can be interacted with.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity >=0.8.0;

contract SimpleContract {
    mapping(uint256 => string) public messages;

    function setMessage(uint256 id, string calldata message) external {
        messages[id] = message;
    }
}
```

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the Batch Precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. You'll need a copy of [`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Batch.sol){target=\_blank} and `SimpleContract.sol`. To add the precompile to Remix and follow along with the tutorial, you will need to:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab
2. Paste the `Batch.sol` contract into a Remix file named **Batch.sol**
3. Paste the `SimpleContract.sol` contract into a Remix file named **SimpleContract.sol**

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile both files in Remix:

1. Make sure that you have the **Batch.sol** file open
2. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
3. To compile the contract, click on **Compile Batch.sol**

![Compiling Batch.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-1.webp)

If the interface was compiled successfully, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Precompile {: #access-the-precompile }

Instead of deploying the Batch Precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note that the precompiled contract is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - MetaMask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **Batch.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract, there is no need to deploy any code. Instead, we are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the Batch Precompile: `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.batch}}` and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-2.webp)

The **BATCH** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Deploy Example Contract {: #deploy-example-contract }

On the other hand, `SimpleContract.sol` will be deployed as a new contract. Before starting this section, repeat the [compilation step](#compile-the-contract) with the `SimpleContract.sol` file.

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - MetaMask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **SimpleContract** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Confirm the MetaMask transaction that appears by clicking **Confirm**

![Deploy SimpleContract](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-3.webp)

The **SIMPLECONTRACT** contract will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Send Native Currency via Precompile {: #send-native-currency-via-precompile }

Sending native currency with the Batch Precompile involves more than pressing a few buttons in Remix or MetaMask. For this example, you will be using the **batchAll** function to send native currency atomically.

Transactions have a value field to specify the amount of native currency sent. In Remix, this is determined by the **VALUE** input in the **DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS** tab. However, for the Batch Precompile, this data is provided within the **value** array input of the batch functions.

Try transferring the native token of your network to two wallets of your choice via the Batch Precompile:

1. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Expand the **batchAll** function
3. For the **to** input, insert your addresses in the following format: `["INSERT_ADDRESS_1", "INSERT_ADDRESS_2"]`, where the first address corresponds to the first wallet of your choice and the second address corresponds to the second wallet of your choice
4. For the **value** input, insert the amount you wish to transfer in Wei for each address. For example, `["1000000000000000000", "2000000000000000000"]` will transfer 1 native token to the first address and 2 native tokens to the second address
5. For **callData**, insert `[]`. Call data is not relevant for simply transferring the native token
6. For the **gasLimit** inputs, insert `[]`
7. Press **transact**
8. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Send Batch Transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-4.webp)

Once the transaction is complete, you can check both of the accounts' balances, either in MetaMask or in your network's block explorer, a link to which can be found on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Congratulations! You've now sent a batched transfer via the Batch Precompile.

!!! note
     Typically if you wanted to send the native currency to or through a contract, you would have to set the value within the overall transaction object and interact with a payable function. However, since the Batch Precompile interacts directly with Substrate code, this is not a typical Ethereum transaction and is thus not necessary.

### Find a Contract Interaction's Call Data {: #find-a-contract-interactions-call-data }

Visual interfaces like [Remix](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and handy libraries like [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} hide the way that Ethereum transactions interact with Solidity smart contracts. The name and input types of a function are hashed into a [function selector](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#function-selector-and-argument-encoding){target=\_blank} and the input data is encoded. These two pieces are then combined and sent as the transaction's call data. To send a subtransaction within a batch transaction, the sender needs to know its call data beforehand.

Try finding a transaction's call data using Remix:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Expand the **setMessage** function
3. Enter the desired **id**, such as `1`
4. Enter the desired **message**, such as `"tanssi"`
5. Instead of sending the transaction, click the copy button next to the **transact** button to copy the call data

![Transaction Call Data](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-5.webp)

Now you have the transaction's call data! Considering the example values of `1` and `"tanssi"`, we can keep an eye out for their encoded values in the call data:

```text
0x648345c8                                                        // function selector
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001  // 1 id
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040  // 32 byte offset
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000   // 32 byte length
674616e7373690000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 // "tanssi" in bytes
```

The call data can be broken into five lines where:

 - The first line is the function selector
 - The second line is equal to 1, which is the **id** that was provided
 - What's left involves the **message** input. These last three lines are tricky since strings are a [dynamic type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#use-of-dynamic-types){target=\_blank} with a dynamic length. The third line refers to an offset to define where the string's data starts. The fourth line refers to the length of the message in the following line, which is 32 bytes total - the "tanssi" message plus padding
 
You can repeat the above steps to capture the call data for values of `2` and `"hello"` such that multiple subcalls can be submitted atomically with the Batch Precompile in the next section. 

### Function Interaction via Precompile {: #function-interaction-via-precompile }

This section's example will be using the **batchAll** function that will ensure the transactions are resolved atomically. Keep in mind that there are also two other batch functions that can either continue subtransactions despite errors or halt subsequent subtransactions but not revert previous ones.

Interacting with a function is very similar to [sending a native currency](#send-native-currency-via-precompile), since they are both transactions. However, call data is required to provide input to functions properly and a sender may desire to limit the amount of gas spent in each subtransaction.

The `callData` and `gasLimit` fields are more relevant for subtransactions that interact with contracts. For each function in the batch interface, the `callData` input is an array where each index corresponds to the call data for each recipient of the subtransaction, that is, each `to` input. If the size of the `callData` array is less than the `to` array, the remaining subtransactions will have no call data (functions with no inputs). The `gasLimit` input is an array that corresponds to the amount of gas that each can spend for each subtransaction. If its value at an index is 0 or the index is the size of the array or greater (and smaller than the `to` array's size), all of the remaining gas from the previous subtransaction is forwarded.

To use the precompile to send an atomic batch transaction combining two contract interactions, take the following steps:

1. Copy the `SimpleContract.sol` contract's address with the copy button on the right side of its header. Be sure also to have the [call data from the previous section](#find-a-contract-interactions-call-data)
2. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For the **to** input, paste the address `SimpleContract.sol` as follows: `["INSERT_SIMPLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS","INSERT_SIMPLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"]`. Note that you'll need to repeat the address for as many transactions you are batching together, even if the contract address is the same
5. For the value input, since `SimpleContract.sol` does not require any native currency to be paid to it, insert `[0,0]` for 0 Wei
6. For the **callData** input, insert your call data from the previous section in the following format: `["INSERT_FIRST_CALL_DATA","INSERT_SECOND_CALL_DATA"]`
7. For the **gasLimit** input, insert `[]`. You can put in a gas limit value for each subcall, or leave it as an empty array
8. Press **transact**
9. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Batch Function Interaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-6.webp)

If you used the same call data as the tutorial, you can check to make sure that the transaction has been successful as follows:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. To the right of the **messages** button, insert `1`
3. Press the blue **messages** button

![SimpleContract Confirmation](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-7.webp)

The phrase **"tanssi"** should appear underneath it. You can repeat the above steps with an id of "2", and you should see **"hello"**. Congratulations! You have interacted with a function with the Batch Precompile.

### Combining Subtransactions {: combining-subtransactions }

So far, transferring native currency and interacting with functions have been separate, but they can be intertwined.

The following four strings can be combined as inputs for a batch transaction. They will send 1 native token to the public Gerald (`0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b`) account and interact with a predeployed `SimpleContract.sol` contract twice. Here is a break-down:

There are three subtransactions which correspond to three addresses in the `to` input array. The first is the public Gerald account and the following two are a `SimpleContract.sol` contract. You can replace the last two with your own instance of `SimpleContract.sol` if you wish. Or, replace only one: you can interact with multiple contracts in a single message.

  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39"
]
```

There will also be three values for the `value` array. The first address in the `to` input array indicates `1000000000000000000` wei or `1` UNIT of the native token. Remember that the native tokens of Tanssi-powered EVM networks have [18 decimal points just like Ethereum](https://eth-converter.com){target=\_blank}. The following two values are `0` because the function that their subtransactions are interacting with does not accept or require native currency.  

```text
["1000000000000000000", "0", "0"]
```

You will need three values for the `callData` array. Since transferring native currency does not require call data, the string is simply blank. The second and third values in the array correspond to invocations of **setMessage** that set messages to IDs 5 and 6.

```text
[
  "0x", 
  "0x648345c8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009796f752061726520610000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

]
```

The final input is for `gas_input`. This array will be left empty to forward all remaining gas to each subtransaction.

```text
[]
```

Try sending a batched transaction with these inputs in Remix the same way [you batched a function call](#function-interaction-via-precompile).

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the ERC-20 precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

## Ethereum Development Libraries {: #ethereum-development-libraries }

If you have followed the [Ethers.js tutorial](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, you may find it difficult to find the call data for a function. The answer is hidden within Ether's `Interface` object, where the [encodeFunctionData](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/abi/#Interface-encodeFunctionData){target=\_blank} function allows you to input your function name and inputs to receive the resultant call data. [Web3.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank} has a similar function, [encodeFunctionCall](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-abi.html#encodefunctioncall){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    The code snippets presented in the following sections are not meant for production environments. Please make sure you adapt it for each use case.

=== "Ethers.js"

     ```js
     // Import the contract ABI
const { abi } = require('./INSERT_ABI_PATH');

// Use ABI to create an interface
const yourContractInterface = new ethers.Interface(abi);

// Find call data for the setMessage function
const callData = yourContractInterface.encodeFunctionData(
  'INSERT_FUNCTION_NAME',
  [
    'INSERT_INPUT_1',
    'INSERT_INPUT_2',
    // ...
  ]
);
     ```

=== "Web3.js"

     ```js
     // Import the contract ABI
const { abi } = require('./INSERT_ABI_PATH');

// Find call data for the setMessage function
const callData = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall(abi, [
  'INSERT_INPUT_1',
  'INSERT_INPUT_2',
  // ...
]);
     ```

=== "Web3.py"

     ```py
     # Import the ABI and bytecode
from compile import abi, bytecode

# Create contract instance
your_contract = web3.eth.contract(abi=abi, bytecode=bytecode)

# Encode the contract call
call_data = your_contract.encodeABI(
    fn_name="INSERT_FUNCTION_NAME", args=["INSERT_INPUT_1", "INSERT_INPUT_2", ...]
)
     ```

Afterwards, you should be all set to interact with the Batch Precompile as one typically would with a contract in [Ethers](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}.

# Interacting with the Call Permit Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Call Permit Precompile on Tanssi-powered EVM networks allows a user to sign a permit, an [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712){target=\_blank} signed message, for any EVM call and it can be dispatched by anyone or any smart contract. It is similar to the Permit Signing of ERC-20 approvals introduced in [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612){target=\_blank}, except it applies to any EVM call instead of only approvals.

When the call permit is dispatched, it is done so on behalf of the user who signed the permit and the user or contract that dispatches the permit is responsible for paying transaction fees. As such, the precompile can be used to perform gas-less transactions.

For example, Alice signs a call permit and Bob dispatches it and performs the call on behalf of Alice. Bob pays for the transaction fees and as such, Alice doesn't need to have any of the native currency to pay for the transaction, unless the call includes a transfer.

The Call Permit Precompile is located at the following address:

```text
{{ networks.demo_evm.precompiles.call_permit }}
```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## The Call Permit Solidity Interface {: #the-call-permit-interface }

[`CallPermit.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/CallPermit.sol){target=\_blank} is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's three methods.

??? code "CallPermit.sol"

    function dispatch(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes memory data,
        uint64 gaslimit,
        uint256 deadline,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) external returns (bytes memory output);

    /// @dev Returns the current nonce for given owner.
    /// A permit must have this nonce to be consumed, which will

    /// @custom:selector 7ecebe00
    function nonces(address owner) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @dev Returns the EIP712 domain separator. It is used to avoid replay
    /// attacks across assets or other similar EIP712 message structures.
    /// @custom:selector 3644e515
    function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32);
}
    ```

The interface includes the following functions:

???+ function "**dispatch**(*address* from, *address* to, *uint256* value, *bytes* data, *uint64[]* gaslimit, *uint256* deadline, *uint8* v, *bytes32* r, *bytes32* s) — dispatches a call on the behalf of another user with a EIP-712 permit. This function can be called by anyone or any smart contract. The transaction will revert if the permit is not valid or if the dispatched call reverts or errors (such as out of gas). If successful, the nonce of the signer is increased to prevent this permit to be replayed"

    === "Parameters"

        - `from` - the signer of the permit. The call will be dispatched on behalf of this address
        - `to` - the address the call is made to
        - `value` - the value being transferred from the `from` account
        - `data` - the call data, or action to be executed
        - `value` - the value being transferred from the `from` account
        - `gasLimit` - the gas limit the dispatched call requires. Providing an argument for this parameter prevents the dispatcher from manipulating the gas limit
        - `deadline` - the time in UNIX seconds after which the permit will no longer be valid. In JavaScript, you can get the current time in UNIX seconds by running `console.log(Date.now())` in a JavaScript script or a browser console
        - `v` - the recovery ID of the signature. The last one byte of the concatenated signature
        - `r` - the first 32 bytes of the concatenated signature
        - `s` - the second 32 bytes of the concatenated signature


??? function "**nonces**(*address* owner) — returns the current nonce for given owner"

    === "Parameters"

        - `owner` - the address of the account to check

??? function "**DOMAIN_SEPARATOR**() — returns the EIP-712 domain separator which is used to avoid replay attacks. It follows the [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification){target=\_blank} implementation"

    === "Parameters"

        None

    === "Returns"
        The EIP-712 domain separator which is used to avoid replay attacks.


The domain separator is defined in the [EIP-712 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712){target=\_blank} and is calculated as:

```text
keccak256(PERMIT_DOMAIN, name, version, chain_id, address)
```

The parameters of the hash can be broken down as follows:

 - **PERMIT_DOMAIN** - is the `keccak256` of `EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)`
 - **name** - is the name of the signing domain and must be `'Call Permit Precompile'` exactly
 - **version** - is the version of the signing domain. For this case **version** is set to `1`
 - **chainId** - is the chain ID of your network
 - **verifyingContract** - is the address of the contract that will verify the signature. In this case, the Call Permit Precompile address

When `dispatch` is called, the permit needs to be verified before the call is dispatched. The first step is to [compute the domain separator](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/ae705bb2e9652204ace66c598a00dcd92445eb81/precompiles/call-permit/src/lib.rs#L138){target=\_blank}. The calculation can be seen in [Moonbeam's implementation](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/ae705bb2e9652204ace66c598a00dcd92445eb81/precompiles/call-permit/src/lib.rs#L112-L126){target=\_blank} or you can check out a practical example in [OpenZeppelin's EIP712 contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol#L70-L84){target=\_blank}.

From there, a [hash of the signature and the given arguments](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/ae705bb2e9652204ace66c598a00dcd92445eb81/precompiles/call-permit/src/lib.rs#L140-L151){target=\_blank} is generated which guarantees that the signature can only be used for the call permit. It uses a given nonce to ensure the signature is not subject to a replay attack. It is similar to [OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Permit` contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-ERC20Permit.sol#L52){target=\_blank}, except the `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is for a call permit, and the arguments match that of the dispatch function plus the nonce.

The domain separator and the hash struct can be used to build the [final hash](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/ae705bb2e9652204ace66c598a00dcd92445eb81/precompiles/call-permit/src/lib.rs#L153-L157){target=\_blank} of the fully encoded message. A practical example is shown in [OpenZeppelin's EIP712 contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4a9cc8b4918ef3736229a5cc5a310bdc17bf759f/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol#L101){target=\_blank}.

With the final hash and the v, r, and s values, the signature can be [verified and recovered](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam/blob/ae705bb2e9652204ace66c598a00dcd92445eb81/precompiles/call-permit/src/lib.rs#L211-L223){target=\_blank}. If successfully verified, the nonce will increase by one and the call will be dispatched.

## Setup the Contracts {: #setup-the-example-contract }

For this example, you'll learn how to sign a call permit that updates a message in a simple example contract, [`SetMessage.sol`](#example-contract). Before you can generate the call permit signature, you'll need to deploy the contract and define the `dispatch` function arguments for the call permit.

Once you've set up the example contract, then you can set up the Call Permit Precompile contract.

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have your wallet configured to work with your EVM network and an account funded with native tokens. You can add your EVM network to MetaMask with one click on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network/){target=\_blank}. Or, you can [configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

### Example Contract {: #example-contract }

The `SetMessage.sol` contract is a perfect example to demonstrate use of the Call Permit Precompile.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

contract SetMessage {
    string storedMessage;

    function set(string calldata x) public {
        storedMessage = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (string memory) {
        return storedMessage;
    }
}
```

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank} to compile the example contract and deploy it. You'll need a copy of [`SetMessage.sol`](#example-contract){target=\_blank} and [`CallPermit.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/CallPermit.sol){target=\_blank}. To add the contracts to Remix, you can take the following steps:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab 
2. Paste the `CallPermit.sol` contract into a Remix file named `CallPermit.sol`
3. Paste the `SetMessage.sol` contract into a Remix file named `SetMessage.sol`

![Copying and pasting the example contract into Remix](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-1.webp)

### Compile & Deploy the Example Contract {: #compile-deploy-example-contract }

First, you'll need to compile the example contract:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab
2. Then to compile the interface, click on **Compile SetMessage.sol**

![Compiling SetMessage.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-2.webp)

Then you can deploy it:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab, directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Note: you are not deploying a contract here, instead you are accessing a precompiled contract that is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** drop down
3. Ensure **SetMessage.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown
4. Click **Deploy**
5. MetaMask will pop up and you'll need to **Confirm** the transaction

![Provide the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-3.webp)

The contract will appear under the list of **Deployed Contracts** on the left side panel. Copy the contract address as you will need to use it to generate the call permit signature in the next section.

### Compile & Access the Call Permit Precompile {: #compile-access-call-permit }

First you'll need to compile the Call Permit Precompile contract:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab
2. Then to compile the interface, click on **Compile CallPermit.sol**

![Compiling SetMessage.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-4.webp)

Then, instead of deploying the contract, you'll just need to access it given the address of the precompile:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab, directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Note: you are not deploying a contract here, instead you are accessing a precompiled contract that is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** drop down
3. Ensure **CallPermit.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract, there is no deployment step. Rather you'll provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
4. Provide the address of the Call Permit Precompile for Tanssi-powered EVM networks: `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.call_permit}}` and click **At Address**
5. The Call Permit Precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**

![Provide the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-5.webp)

## Generate Call Permit Signature {: #generate-call-permit-signature}

In order to interact with the Call Permit Precompile, you have to have or generate a signature to dispatch the call permit. There are several ways you can generate the signature. This guide will show how to generate the signature using [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank}.

Here's an overview of the steps that you'll need to take to obtain the signature:

1. The `message` will be created and includes some of the data that is needed to create the call permit. It includes the arguments that will be passed into the `dispatch` function and the nonce of the signer
2. A JSON structure of the data the user needs to sign will be assembled for the call permit and include all of the types for the `dispatch` arguments and the nonce. This will result in the `CallPermit` type and will be saved as the `primaryType`
3. The domain separator will be created using `"Call Permit Precompile"` exactly for the name, the version of your dApp or platform, the chain ID of the network the signature is to be used on, and the address of the contract that will verify the signature. Note that you'll need to specify the chain ID of your network in the script to generate the correct signature
4. All of the assembled data will be signed using Ethers.js
5. The signature will be returned and you can use [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank} [`Signature.from` method](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/crypto/#Signature_from){target=\_blank} to return the `v`, `r`, and `s` values of the signature

### The Call Permit Arguments {: #call-permit-arguments }

As seen in the [Call Permit Interface](#the-call-permit-interface) section, the `dispatch` function takes the following parameters: `from`, `to`, `value`, `data`, `gasLimit`, `deadline`, `v`, `r`, and `s`.

In order to get the signature arguments (`v`, `r`, and `s`), you'll need to sign a message containing the arguments for the remainder of the aforementioned parameters, plus the nonce of the signer.

- `from` - the address of the account you want to sign the call permit with
- `to` - the contract address for the `SetMessage.sol` contract
- `value` - can be `0` for this example as you'll just be setting a message instead of transferring any funds
- `data` - you can send any message you would like. You'll just need the hex representation of the message you want to set using the `SetMessage.sol` contract. This will contain the function selector of the `set` function and the string of the message. For this example, you can send `hello world`. To do so, you can use this hex representation:
     ```text
     0x4ed3885e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b68656c6c6f20776f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
     ```
- `gasLimit` - `100000` will be enough to send the dispatched call
- `deadline` - you can get the current time in UNIX seconds by running `console.log(Date.now())` in a JavaScript script or a browser console. Once you have the current time, you should generously add additional seconds to represent when the call permit will expire

The nonce of the signer will also be needed. If this is your first time signing a call permit the nonce will be `0`. You can also check the nonce in Remix:

1. Expand the call permit contract
2. Next to the **nonces** function, enter the address of the signer and click on **nonces**
3. The result will be returned directly under the function

![Get the nonce](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-6.webp)

### Use Ethers to Create the Signature {: #use-ethers-to-create-the-signature }

To generate the call permit signature using JavaScript and Ethers, you'll first need to create a project locally. You can do so with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir call-permit-example && cd call-permit-example && touch getSignature.js
npm init -y
```

You should now have a file where you can create the script to get the signature along with a `package.json` file. Open the `package.json` file, and below the `"dependencies"` section, add:

```json
"type": "module"
```

Next, you can install [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/){target=\_blank}:

```bash
npm i ethers
```

!!! remember
    Never reveal your private keys, as they give direct access to your funds. The following steps are for demonstration purposes only.

In the `getSignature.js` file, you can copy and edit the following code snippet. In addition to the fields discussed above in the [Call Permit arguments section](#call-permit-arguments), you'll need to insert the Chain ID of your network in the Domain Separator component to properly generate the signature. If you use an incorrect Chain ID, the generated signature will be invalid and no transaction can be dispatched.

???+ code "getSignature.js"

    ```js
    import { ethers } from 'ethers';

const from = 'INSERT_FROM_ADDRESS';
const to = 'INSERT_TO_ADDRESS';

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash

```

In the console, you should see the concatenated signature along with the values for the signature including the `v`, `r`, and `s` values. Copy these values as you'll need them when interacting with the Call Permit Precompile in the following sections.

![Signature values in the console](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-7.webp)

!!! note
    Take care when copying the `v`, `r`, and `s` values to the `dispatch` method of the precompile. The ordering of `v`, `r`, and `s` values in the precompile may not be the same as output by the script. 

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

Now that you have generated the call permit signature, you will be able to test out calling the `dispatch` function of the Call Permit Precompile.

### Dispatch a Call {: #dispatch-a-call }

When you send the `dispatch` function, you'll need the same arguments as you used to sign the call permit. To get started, go back to the **Deploy and Run** tab in Remix, and under the **Deployed Contracts** section, expand the call permit contract. Make sure that you're connected to the account that you want to consume the call permit and pay the transaction fees. Then take the following steps:

1. For the **from** field, enter the account address you used to sign the call permit with
2. Copy and paste the contract address of `SetMessage.sol`
3. Enter `0` for the **value** field
4. Enter the hex representation of the function selector for the `set` function and the string you want to set as the message for the `SetMessage.sol` contract. For this example, `hello world` can be used:
     ```text
     0x4ed3885e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b68656c6c6f20776f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
     ```
5. Enter `100000` for the **gasLimit** field
6. Enter the `deadline` you used when signing the call permit
7. Copy the `v` value you should have retrieved while generating the call permit signature and paste it into the **v** field
8. Copy the `r` value you should have retrieved while generating the call permit signature and paste it into the **r** field
9. Copy the `s` value you should have retrieved while generating the call permit signature and paste it into the **s** field
10. Click **transact** to send the transaction
11. MetaMask should pop up and you can confirm the transaction

![Dispatch the call permit](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-8.webp)

Once the transaction goes through, you can verify that the message was updated to `hello world`. To do so, you can:

1. Expand the `SetMessage.sol` contract
2. Click on **get**
3. The result will appear below the function, and it should show `hello world`

![Verify the dispatch was executed as intended](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/call-permit/call-9.webp)

Congratulations! You've successfully generated a call permit signature and used it to dispatch a call on behalf of the call permit signer.

description: Learn how to use the XCM interface precompile to transfer tokens from any Tanssi-powered EVM network, leveraging their inherent native cross-chain capabilities.

# Native Cross-Chain Token Transfers

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As presented in the [Native Cross-Chain Communication](/learn/framework/xcm/){target=\_blank} article from the Learn section, Tanssi-powered networks benefit from an inherent capability to communicate and interoperate with any other network in the ecosystem. This native cross-chain communication allows safe and fast token transfers leveraging the Cross-Consensus Message format (XCM for short), which facilitates communication between different consensus systems.

The communication protocol enabling token transfers is built on [Substrate](/learn/framework/overview/#substrate-framework){target=\_blank} and runs on a lower level than the EVM, making it harder for EVM developers to access.

Nevertheless, EVM networks have an XCM precompile that fills the gap between execution layers, exposing a smart contract interface that abstracts away the underlying complexities, making the execution of cross-chain token transfers as easy as any other smart contract call.

This guide will show you how to interact with the [XCM Interface](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/XcmInterface.sol){target=\_blank} precompile to execute cross-chain token transfers through the Ethereum API.

The XCM precompile is located at the following address:

```text
{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.xcm_interface }}
```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## The XCM Solidity Interface {: #the-xcm-solidity-interface }

The [`XCMInterface.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/XcmInterface.sol){target=\_blank} interface on Tanssi EVM networks is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's functions.

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have your wallet configured to work with your EVM network and an account funded with native tokens. You can add your EVM network to MetaMask with one click on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Or, you can [configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    It is necessary to have previously established communication channels with the destination chain before using this precompile's functionality. To do so, refer to the [Manage Cross-Chain Communication Channels](/builders/manage/dapp/xcm-channels/){target=\_blank} guide.
    Also, if the token being transferred is native to your network, the destination chain must have registered the foreign asset.

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the XCM Interface precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. To add the precompile to Remix, you will need to:

1. Get a copy of [`XCMInterface.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/XcmInterface.sol){target=\_blank}
2. Paste the file contents into a Remix file named `XcmInterface.sol`

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile the interface in Remix:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Compile the interface by clicking on **Compile XCMInterface.sol**

![Compiling XcmInterface.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-1.webp)

When the compilation is completed, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract }

Instead of deploying the precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note that the precompiled contracts are already accessible at their respective addresses. Therefore, there is no deployment step
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - Metamask**, you may be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix if it's not already connected
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **XCM - XCMInterface.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Given that it is a precompiled contract, there is no deployment step. Instead, you are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the precompile: `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.xcm_interface}}` and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-2.webp)

The **XCM Interface** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Send Tokens Over to Another EVM-Compatible Network {: #transfer-to-evm-chains }

To send tokens over to an account in another EVM-compatible network, please follow these steps:

1. Expand the **transferAssetsToPara20** function
2. Enter the network ID (paraId)
3. Enter the 20-bytes (Ethereum-like) destination account (beneficiary)
4. Specify the tokens to be transferred. Note that this parameter is an array that contains at least one asset. Each asset is specified by its address and the total amount to transfer

    !!! note
    Tokens are specified by their ERC-20 address. If the token you want to transfer is the network's native one, the [Native Token ERC-20 Precompile](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/){target=\_blank} will help you reference it through an ERC-20 interface.

5. Enter the index of the asset that will be used to pay the fees. This index is zero-based, so the first element is `0`, the second is `1`, and so on 
6. Enter the maximum gas to pay for the transaction. This gas is derived from two parameters, the processing time (`refTime`) and the proof size (`proofSize`). In practice, setting refTime to `uint64::MAX` is equal to *unlimited weight*
7. Click **transact**
8. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Confirm Approve Transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-3.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, wait for a few blocks for the transfer to reach the destination chain and reflect the new balance.

### Send Tokens Over to a Substrate Network {: #transfer-to-substrate-chains }

To send tokens over to an account in a Substrate network, please follow these steps:

1. Expand the **transferAssetsToPara32** function
2. Enter the network ID (`paraId`)
3. Enter the sr25519-type destination account (beneficiary)
4. Specify the tokens to be transferred. Note that this parameter is an array that contains at least one asset. Each asset is specified by its address and the total amount to transfer
    
    !!! note
    Tokens are specified by their ERC-20 address. If the token you want to transfer is the network's native one, the [Native Token ERC-20 Precompile](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/){target=\_blank} will help you reference it through an ERC-20 interface.

5. Enter the index of the asset that will be used to pay the fees. This index is zero-based, so the first element is `0`, the second is `1`, and so on 
6. Enter the maximum gas to pay for the transaction. This gas is derived from two parameters, the processing time (refTime) and the proof size (proofSize). In practice, setting refTime to `uint64::MAX` is equal to *unlimited weight*
7. Click **transact**
8. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Confirm Approve Transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-4.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, wait for a few blocks for the transfer to reach the destination chain and reflect the new balance.

### Send Tokens Over to the Relay Chain {: #transfer-to-relay-chain }

To send tokens over to an account in the relay chain, please follow these steps:

1. Expand the **transferAssetsToRelay** function
2. Enter the sr25519-type destination account (beneficiary)
3. Specify the tokens to be transferred. Note that this parameter is an array that contains at least one asset. Each asset is specified by its address and the total amount to transfer
    
    !!! note
    Tokens are specified by their ERC-20 address. If the token you want to transfer is the network's native one, the [Native Token ERC-20 Precompile](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/){target=\_blank} will help you reference it through an ERC-20 interface.

4. Enter the index of the asset that will be used to pay the fees. This index is zero-based, so the first element is `0`, the second is `1`, and so on 
5. Enter the maximum gas to pay for the transaction. This gas is derived from two parameters, the processing time (refTime) and the proof size (proofSize). In practice, setting refTime to `uint64::MAX` is equal to *unlimited weight*
6. Click **transact**
7. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Confirm Approve Transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-5.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, wait for a few blocks for the transfer to reach the destination chain and reflect the new balance.

### Send Tokens Over Specific Locations {: #transfer-locations }

This function is more generic than the others, allowing the destination chain, destination account, and assets to be specified using [XCM Multilocations](/learn/framework/xcm/#message-destinations){target=\_blank}.
To send tokens to specific locations, please follow these steps:

1. Expand the **transferAssetsLocation** function
2. Enter the multilocation that specifies the destination chain. Note that any chain can be specified, regardless of its configuration or type
3. Enter the Multilocation that specifies the destination account. Note that any account can be specified, regardless of its type (ECDSA, sr25519, or any other)
4. Specify the tokens to be transferred. Note that this parameter is an array that contains at least one asset and each asset is specified by its Multilocation and the total amount to transfer
    
    !!! note
    Tokens are specified by their ERC-20 address. If the token you want to transfer is the network's native one, the [Native Token ERC-20 Precompile](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/){target=\_blank} will help you reference it through an ERC-20 interface.

5. Enter the index of the asset that will be used to pay the fees. This index is zero-based, so the first element is `0`, the second is `1`, and so on 
6. Enter the maximum gas to pay for the transaction. This gas is derived from two parameters, the processing time (refTime) and the proof size (proofSize). In practice, setting refTime to `uint64::MAX` is equal to *unlimited weight*
7. Click **transact**
8. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Confirm Approve Transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/xcm-interface/xcm-interface-6.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, wait for a few blocks for the transfer to reach the destination chain and reflect the new balance.

#  Native Token ERC-20 Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The native token ERC-20 precompiled contract on Tanssi-powered EVM networks allows developers to interact with the native protocol token through an ERC-20 interface. Although your network's native token is not an ERC-20 token, now you can interact with it as if it was a vanilla ERC-20.

One of the main benefits of this precompile is that it removes the necessity of having a wrapped representation of the protocol token as an ERC-20 smart contract, such as WETH on Ethereum. Furthermore, it minimizes the need for multiple wrapped representations of the same protocol token. Consequently, dApps that need to interact with the protocol token via an ERC-20 interface can do so without needing a separate smart contract.

Under the hood, the [ERC-20 precompile](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank} executes specific Substrate actions related to the Substrate balances module, which is coded in Rust. The balances module provides functionality for handling the various types of balances.

This guide will show you how to interact with UNIT tokens, the native protocol tokens for quick trial networks on [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}, via the ERC-20 precompile. You can follow along and adapt this guide to interacting with your own network.

The precompile is located at the following address:

```text
{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.erc20 }}
```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## The ERC-20 Solidity Interface {: #the-erc20-interface }

The [`ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank} interface on Tanssi EVM networks follows the [EIP-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}, which is the standard API interface for tokens within smart contracts. The standard defines the required functions and events a token contract must implement to be interoperable with different applications.

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have your wallet configured to work with your Tanssi-powered EVM network and an account funded with native tokens. You can add your EVM network to MetaMask with one click on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Or, you can [configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM network](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

### Add Token to an EVM Wallet {: #add-token-to-evm-wallet }

If you want to interact with your network's native token like you would with an ERC-20, you can add a custom token to your EVM-compatible wallet using the precompile address. This section will walk you through adding an external asset to [MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

To get started, open up MetaMask and make sure you are connected to your network and:

1. Switch to the **Assets** tab
2. Click on **Import tokens**

![Import Tokens from Assets Tab in MetaMask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-1.webp)

Now, you can create a custom token:

1. Enter the precompile address for the token contract address - `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.erc20 }}`. When you enter the address, the **Token Symbol** and **Token Decimal** fields should automatically populate. If they do not, you can enter `UNIT` for the symbol and `18` for the decimal places. Recall that the default number of decimals for Tanssi EVM networks is `18`, the same as Ethereum's token decimals
2. Click **Next**

![Add Custom Token](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-2.webp)

MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the import. You can review the token details and click **Import Tokens** to import UNIT tokens into your wallet.

![Confirm and Import Tokens](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-3.webp)

And that's it! You've successfully added the UNIT token as a custom ERC-20 token on your Tanssi EVM network.

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the ERC-20 precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. To add the precompile to Remix, you will need to:

1. Get a copy of [`ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank}
2. Paste the file contents into a Remix file named `IERC20.sol`

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile the interface in Remix:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Compile the interface by clicking on **Compile IERC20.sol**

![Compiling IERC20.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-4.webp)

When compilation is completed, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract }

Instead of deploying the ERC-20 precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note that the precompiled contracts are already accessible at their respective addresses. Therefore, there is no deployment step
2. Make sure **Injected Web3** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Web3**, you may be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix if it's not already connected
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **IERC20 - IERC20.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Given that it is a precompiled contract, there is no deployment step. Instead, you are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the ERC-20 precompile: `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.erc20}}` and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-5.webp)

The **IERC20** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Get Basic Token Information {: #get-basic-token-information }

The ERC-20 interface lets you quickly obtain token information, including the token's total supply, name, symbol, and decimal places. You can retrieve this information by following these steps:

1. Expand the **IERC20** contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Click **decimals** to get the decimal places of your network's native protocol token
3. Click **name** to get the name of the token
4. Click **symbol** to get the symbol of the token
5. Click **totalSupply** to obtain the total supply of native tokens on your network

![Total Supply](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-6.webp)

The results of each function call are displayed under the respective functions.

### Get Account Balance {: #get-account-balance }

You can check the balance of any address on your network by calling the `balanceOf` function and passing in an address:

1. Expand the **balanceOf** function
2. Enter an address you would like to check the balance of for the **owner**
2. Click **call**

![Get Balance of an Account](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-7.webp)

Your balance will be displayed under the `balanceOf` function.

### Approve a Spend {: #approve-a-spend }

To approve a token spend allowance, you'll need to provide an address for the spender and the number of tokens the spender is allowed to spend. The spender can be an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract. For this example, you can approve the spender with an allowance of 1 UNIT token. To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Expand the **approve** function
2. Enter the address of the spender. You should have created two accounts before starting, so you can use the second account as the spender
3. Enter the amount of tokens the spender can spend for the **value**. For this example, you can allow the spender to spend 1 UNIT token in Wei units (`1000000000000000000`)
4. Click **transact**
5. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Confirm Approve Transaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-8.webp)

After the transaction is confirmed, you'll notice that the balance of your account has stayed the same. This is because you have only approved the allowance for the given amount, and the spender hasn't spent the funds. In the next section, you will use the `allowance` function to verify that the spender can spend 1 UNIT token on your behalf.

### Get Allowance of Spender {: #get-allowance-of-spender }

To check that the spender received the allowance approved in the [Approve a Spend](#approve-a-spend) section, you can:

1. Expand the **allowance** function
2. Enter your address for the **owner**
3. Enter the address of the **spender** that you used in the previous section
4. Click **call**

![Get Allowance of Spender](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-9.webp)

Once the call is complete, the allowance of the spender will be displayed, which should be equivalent to 1 UNIT token (`1000000000000000000`).

### Send Transfer {: #send-transfer }

To send tokens from your account directly to another account, you can call the `transfer` function by following these steps:

1. Expand the **transfer** function
2. Enter the address to send UNIT tokens to
3. Enter the amount of UNIT tokens to send. For this example, you can send 1 UNIT token (`1000000000000000000`)
4. Click **transact**
5. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Send Standard Transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-10.webp)

Once the transaction is complete, you can [check your balance](#get-account-balance) using the `balanceOf` function or by looking at MetaMask. You'll notice that your balance has decreased by 1 UNIT token. You can also use the `balanceOf` function to ensure that the recipients balance has increased by 1 UNIT token as expected.

### Send Transfer From Specific Account {: #send-transferfrom }

So far, you have approved an allowance of 1 UNIT token for the spender and sent 1 UNIT token via the standard `transfer` function. The `transferFrom` function varies from the standard `transfer` function as it allows you to define the address to which you want to send the tokens. So you can specify an address with an allowance or your address as long as you have funds. For this example, you will use the spender's account to initiate a transfer of the allowed funds from the owner to the spender. The spender can send the funds to any account, but you can send the funds from the owner to the spender for this example.

First, you need to switch to the spender's account in MetaMask. Once you switch to the spender's account, you'll notice that the selected address in Remix under the **Accounts** tab is now the spender's.

![Switch accounts Remix](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-11.webp)

Next, you can initiate and send the transfer. To do so, take the following steps:

1. Expand the **transferFrom** function
2. Enter your address as the owner in the **from** field
3. Enter the recipient address, which should be the spender's address, in the **to** field
4. Enter the amount of UNIT tokens to send. Again, the spender is currently only allowed to send 1 UNIT token, so enter `1000000000000000000`
5. Click **transact**

![Send Standard Transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-12.webp)

Once the transaction is complete, you can [check the balance](#get-account-balance) of the owner and spender using the `balanceOf` function. The spender's balance should have increased by 1 UNIT token, and their allowance should now be depleted. To verify that the spender no longer has an allowance, you can call the `allowance` function by passing in the owner and spender's addresses. You should receive a result of 0.

![Zero Allowance](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/erc20/erc-13.webp)

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the ERC-20 precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

# External Assets as ERC-20

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As presented in the [Native Cross-Chain Communication](/learn/framework/xcm/){target=\_blank} article, networks deployed through Tanssi can communicate and interoperate with any other network in the ecosystem. This multi-chain environment leads to a multi-asset world, where seamless transfer of assets, data, and value across different networks widens the possibilities to build use cases across diverse industries such as finance (DeFi), real-world assets (RWAs), and others.

External assets are tokens native to another blockchain, or, in other words, assets whose reserve chain is not the chain you are interacting with. Tanssi networks can register external assets to enable their inflow. To do so, it is necessary to [establish an XCM channel](/learn/framework/xcm/#channel-registration){target=\_blank} with the other chain and then register one of its native assets as an external asset. Registered external assets behave, to some extent, the same way as local ones.

The [ERC-20 assets precompile](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20Instance.sol){target=\_blank} allows networks based on the [Tanssi EVM template](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank} to access any registered external asset through the standard ERC-20 interface. Consequently, smart contracts deployed to the network can interact with such assets as they would with any other regular ERC-20.

The address representing the ERC-20 contract is formed with the first thirty-six positions (eighteen bytes) set to the maximum value and the last four positions (two bytes) replaced with the hexadecimal representation of the registered asset identifier:

```text
{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.external_assets_erc20}}
```

For example, for the asset whose ID is `1`, the last four positions must be replaced with `0001`, and for an asset with an ID of `10`, those four positions must be replaced with `000A`.

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites {: #prerequisites }

 Tto follow along with the contents in this guide, you'll need:
 
- Access to a Tanssi EVM network running [runtime 500](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/tag/runtime-500){target=\_blank} or above
- An established bidirectional XCM channel to another chain. To manage your network's channels, refer to the [Manage Cross-Chain Communication Channels](/builders/manage/dapp/xcm-channels/){target=\_blank} article
- A registered external asset. Once the XCM channels are open, asset registration can be easily done using the [dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network/){target=\_blank} as explained in the [Register External Assets](/builders/manage/dapp/register-external-assets/){target=\_blank} guide
- Finally, you'll need an [EVM-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/){target=\_blank} configured to work with your network. You can also connect your wallet to the [demo EVM network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}.

The examples in this guide are based on the Tanssi demo EVM network, which already has open channels to other networks and registered external assets, as the following picture shows:

## The ERC-20 Solidity Interface {: #the-erc20-interface }

The [`ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank} interface on Tanssi EVM networks follows the [EIP-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20){target=\_blank}, which is the standard API interface for tokens within smart contracts. The standard defines the required functions and events a token contract must implement to be interoperable with different applications.

## Add Token to an EVM Wallet {: #add-token-to-evm-wallet }

If you want to interact with your network's registered external assets like you would with an ERC-20, you can add them to your wallet using the precompile address prefix and the asset ID. This section will walk you through adding an external asset to [MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

To get started, open up MetaMask and make sure you are connected to your network and:

1. Switch to the **Tokens** tab
2. Click on **Import tokens**

    ![Import Tokens from Tokens Tab in MetaMask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-2.webp)

Before continuing, you'll need the token's address, which, considering that in this example the external asset has an ID of `1`, will be:

```text
{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.external_assets_erc20_example}}
```

1. Enter the precompile address for the token contract address. When you enter the address, the **Token Symbol** and **Token Decimal** fields should automatically populate. If they do not, you can enter `UNIT` for the symbol and `12` for the decimal places
2. Click **Next**

![Add External Asset](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-3.webp)

MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the import. You can review the token details and click **Import Tokens** to import UNIT tokens into your wallet.

![Confirm and Import Tokens](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-4.webp)

And that's it! You've successfully added the UNIT token external asset as a custom ERC-20 token on the Tanssi demo EVM network.

## Interact with the Solidity Interface via Remix {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface-via-remix }

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the external assets ERC-20 precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. To add the precompile to Remix, you will need to:

1. Get a copy of [`ERC20.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/ERC20.sol){target=\_blank}
2. Paste the file contents into a Remix file named `IERC20.sol`

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile the interface in Remix:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Compile the interface by clicking on **Compile IERC20.sol**

![Compiling IERC20.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-5.webp)

When compilation is completed, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract }

Instead of deploying the smart contract, you will access the interface through the address of external asset precompile:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note that the precompiled contracts are already accessible at their respective addresses. Therefore, there is no deployment step
2. Make sure **Injected Web3** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Web3**, you may be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix if it's not already connected
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **IERC20 - IERC20.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Given that it is a precompiled contract, there is no deployment step. Instead, you are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the ERC-20 precompile (which is `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.external_assets_erc20_example}}` in this example) and click **At Address**
6. The **IERC20** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-6.webp)

### Get Basic Token Information {: #get-basic-token-information }

The ERC-20 interface lets you quickly obtain token information, including the token's total supply, name, symbol, and decimal places. You can retrieve this information by following these steps:

1. Expand the **IERC20** contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Click **decimals** to get the decimal places of your network's native protocol token
3. Click **name** to get the name of the token
4. Click **symbol** to get the symbol of the token
5. Click **totalSupply** to obtain the total supply of native tokens on your network

![Get basic token information](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-7.webp)

The results of each function call are displayed under the respective functions.

### Get Account Balance {: #get-account-balance }

You can check the balance of any address on your network by calling the `balanceOf` function and passing in an address:

1. Expand the **balanceOf** function
2. Enter an address you would like to check the balance of for the **owner**
2. Click **call**

![Get Balance of an Account](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-8.webp)

Your balance will be displayed under the `balanceOf` function.

### Send Transfer {: #send-transfer }

To send tokens from your account directly to another account, you can call the `transfer` function by following these steps:

1. Expand the **transfer** function
2. Enter the address to send UNIT tokens to
3. Enter the amount of UNIT tokens to send. For this example, you can send 1 UNIT token (`1000000000000`)
4. Click **transact**
5. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click **Confirm** to send the transaction

![Send Standard Transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/external-assets-erc20/external-assets-erc20-9.webp)

Once the transaction is complete, you can [check your balance](#get-account-balance) using the `balanceOf` function or by looking at MetaMask. You'll notice that your balance has decreased by 1 UNIT token. You can also use the `balanceOf` function to ensure that the recipients balance has increased by 1 UNIT token as expected.

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the external assets ERC-20 precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

# Interacting with the Proxy Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Proxy Precompile allows accounts to set proxy accounts via the Ethereum API. Proxy accounts can perform limited actions on behalf of the proxied account, such as governance, balance transfers, management or privileged transactions, and others.

If a user wanted to provide another user access to a limited number of actions on their behalf, traditionally, the only method to do so would be to share that account's private key. However, Tanssi-powered EVM networks include the proxy module, providing an additional layer of security. With proxies, many accounts can perform actions for a primary account, and such permissions can be revoked at any time. This is best if, for example, a user wants to keep their wallet safe in cold storage but still wants to access parts of the wallet's functionality, like governance or staking.  

!!! note
    The Proxy Precompile can only be called from an Externally Owned Account (EOA) or by the [Batch Precompile](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/){target=\_blank}.

To learn more about proxy accounts and how to set them up for your own purposes without use of the Proxy Precompile, visit the [Proxy Accounts](/builders/account-management/proxy-accounts/){target=\_blank} page.

The Proxy Precompile is located at the following address:

```text
{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.proxy}}
```

!!! note
    There can be some unintended consequences when using precompiles. Tanssi's precompiles are derived from Moonbeam's, and as such, please familiarize yourself with [Moonbeam's Precompile Security Considerations](https://docs.moonbeam.network/builders/get-started/eth-compare/security){target=\_blank}.

## Prerequisites {: #prerequisites }

 Tto follow along with the contents in this guide, you'll need:
 
- Access to a Tanssi-powered EVM network running [runtime 700](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/tag/runtime-700){target=\_blank} or above
- An [EVM-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/){target=\_blank} configured to work with your network. You can also connect your wallet to the [demo EVM network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}
- An account with enough funds to pay the required fees and deposits
- A second account that you control to use as a proxy

## The Proxy Solidity Interface {: #the-proxy-solidity-interface }

[`Proxy.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Proxy.sol){target=\_blank} is an interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's functions.

The interface includes the necessary data structures along with the following functions:

???+ function "**addProxy**(delegate, proxyType, delay) — registers a proxy account for the sender after a specified number of `delay` blocks (generally zero). Will fail if a proxy for the caller already exists"

    === "Parameters"

        - `delegate` ++"address"++ - the proxy address
        - `proxyType` ++"ProxyType"++ - the delegation type that defines the specific functions the proxy will be granted permission to execute
        - `delay` ++"uint32"++ - number of blocks to wait until the proxy is enabled

    === "Example"

        - `delegate` - 0x3f0Aef9Bd799F1291b80376aD57530D353ab0217
        - `proxyType` - "Any"
        - `delay` - 0

??? function "**removeProxy**(delegate, proxyType, delay) — removes a registered proxy for the sender"

    === "Parameters"

        - `delegate` ++"address"++ - the proxy address to remove
        - `proxyType` ++"ProxyType"++ - the delegation type to remove
        - `delay` ++"uint32"++ - number of blocks to wait until the removal is in effect

    === "Example"

        - `delegate` - 0x3f0Aef9Bd799F1291b80376aD57530D353ab0217
        - `proxyType` - "Any"
        - `delay` - 0

??? function "**removeProxies**() — removes all of the proxy accounts delegated to the sender"

??? function "**isProxy**(real, delegate, proxyType, delay) — returns `true` if the delegate address is a proxy of type `proxyType`, for address `real`, with the specified `delay`"

    === "Parameters"

        - `real` ++"address"++ - the account granting permissions to the proxy
        - `delegate` ++"address"++ - the proxy address
        - `proxyType` ++"ProxyType"++ - the delegation type
        - `delay` ++"uint32"++ - number of blocks to wait

    === "Example"

        - `delegate` - 0xbB8919d5DDfc85F4D15820a9e58018f1cfB39a2F
        - `delegate` - 0x3f0Aef9Bd799F1291b80376aD57530D353ab0217
        - `proxyType` - "Any"
        - `delay` - 0

[The `proxyType` parameter](#proxy-types) is defined by the following `ProxyType` enum, where the values start at `0` with the most permissive proxy type and are represented as `uint8` values:

```solidity
enum ProxyType {
    Any,
    NonTransfer,
    Governance,
    Staking,
    CancelProxy,
    Balances,
    AuthorMapping,
    IdentityJudgement
}
```

### Proxy Types {: #proxy-types }

There are multiple types of proxy roles that can be delegated to accounts, represented in `Proxy.sol` through the `ProxyType` enum. The following list includes all of the possible proxies and the type of transactions they can make on behalf of the primary account:

- **Any** — the any proxy will allow the proxy account to make any type of transaction. Note that balance transfers are only allowed to EOAs, not contracts or Precompiles
- **NonTransfer** — the non-transfer proxy allows the proxy account to make any type of transaction where the `msg.value` is checked to be zero
- **Governance** - the governance proxy will allow the proxy account to make any type of governance related transaction
- **CancelProxy** - the cancel proxy will allow the proxy account to reject and remove delayed proxy announcements (of the primary account). Currently, this is not an action supported by the Proxy Precompile
- **Balances** - the balances proxy will allow the proxy account to only make balance transfers to EOAs
 
!!! note
    The Solidity interface contains more proxy types than those listed above. The previous list includes only those proxy types implemented in the [baseline EVM Template](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank}.

## Interact with the Solidity Interface via Remix {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface-via-remix }

This section will walk you through the steps to create a proxy, verify its creation, and revoke the proxy privileges. These examples are based on the [Tanssi demo EVM Network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank} and use [Metamask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}. This guide can be adapted for your own Tanssi-powered EVM network by adding the RPC URL of your network to the EVM Wallet of your choosing.

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the Proxy precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. To add the precompile to Remix, you will need to:

1. Get a copy of [`Proxy.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Proxy.sol){target=\_blank}
2. Paste the file contents into a Remix file named `Proxy.sol`

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile the interface in Remix:

1. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
2. Then to compile the interface, click on **Compile Proxy.sol**

![Compiling Proxy.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/proxy/proxy-1.webp)

When compilation is completed, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Contract {: #access-the-contract }

Instead of deploying the smart contract, you will access the interface through its address:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - Metamask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. You may be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix if it's not already connected
3. Make sure the priimary account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **Proxy - Proxy.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Given that it is a precompiled contract, there is no deployment step. Instead, you are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the Proxy precompile (which is `{{networks.demo_evm.precompiles.proxy}}` in this example) and click **At Address**
6. The **Proxy** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/proxy/proxy-2.webp)

### Add a Proxy {: #add-proxy }

You can add a proxies for your account calling the precompile functions. In the following example, you will add a proxy allowed to execute any transaction on your behalf:

1. Expand the Proxy Precompile contract to see the available functions
2. Find the **addProxy** function and press the button to expand the section
3. Insert your second account's address as the **delegate**, `0` as **proxyType**, meaning `any`, and `0` as **delay**
4. Click **transact**
5. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click Confirm to execute the transaction

!!! note
     When constructing the transaction in Remix, the **proxyType** is represented as a `uint8`, instead of the expected enum `ProxyType`. In Solidity, enums are compiled as `uint8`, so when you pass in `0` for **proxyType**, you indicate the first element in the `ProxyType` enum, which is the `any` proxy.

![Call the addProxy function](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/proxy/proxy-3.webp)

### Check a Proxy Existence {: #check-proxy }

The function `isProxy` checks if a proxy account exists. After creating a proxy in the [previous step](#add-proxy), use the same parameters to verify that the proxy was successfully added:

1. Expand the **isProxy** function
2. Insert your primary account as **real**, your second account (proxy) as **delegate**, `0` as **proxyType**, and `0` as **delay**
3. Click **call**
4. The functions returns whether there is a proxy or not. In this example, the proxy exists, hence the function returns `true`

![Call the isProxy function](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/proxy/proxy-4.webp)

### Remove a Proxy {: #remove-proxy }

You can revoke a proxy permission when it's no longer needed. After creating a proxy in the [Add Proxy](#add-proxy), step, it can be removed following these steps:

1. Expand the **removeProxy** function
2. Insert the proxy account as the **delegate**, `0` as **proxyType**, `0` and as **delay**
3. Click **transact** 
4. MetaMask will pop up, and you will be prompted to review the transaction details. Click Confirm to execute the transaction

After the transaction is confirmed, if you repeat the steps to [check for a proxy existence](#check-proxy), the result should be `false`.

![Call the removeProxy function](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/proxy/proxy-5.webp)

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the Proxy precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

# Interacting with Tanssi-powered EVM appchains Using Ledger

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers and users of Tanssi-powered EVM appchains, such as the [Tanssi demo](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank} EVM appchain, have a variety of options when it comes to wallets. Regarding cold wallets, which store your private keys in a secure, offline environment, [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/){target=\_blank} is one of the most popular options. Ledger provides full support for Substrate blockchains, such as the Tanssi network.

Ledger devices are hardware wallets designed to store the private keys offline. They are used to verify and sign the transactions, but they still need a software layer to provide the UI that interacts with the networks, builds the transactions, and sends the signed transactions back to the network once the user has verified them.

This guide takes you through all the necessary steps to use your Ledger device with Tanssi-powered EVM appchains.

## Setting Up Your Ledger Device {: #setting-up-ledger-device }

If you have a brand new Ledger device, refer to the [official website](https://support.ledger.com/article/4404389503889-zd){target=\_blank} for a guide on getting it started with the initial setup.

Now, with your Ledger already initiated, install the _Ethereum_ app taking the following steps:

1. Open the Ledger Live App on your computer.
2. Go to My Ledger.
3. Connect and unlock the device.

Finally, search for the **Ethereum (ETH)** app in Ledger Live and install it on your device.

![Install Ethereum in Ledger Live](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/ledger/ledger-1.webp)

And that's it. Your device now has an Ethereum account and is able to sign transactions on any Tanssi-powered EVM appchain.

## Adding the Ledger to a Hot Wallet {: #adding-Ledger-hot-wallet }

As presented in the [introduction](#introduction), a Ledger hardware wallet provides secure, offline storage for private keys, allowing users to verify and sign transactions. However, by design, it can't interact with blockchains or dApps by itself, nor does it offer a UI for managing assets. To complement the device, a hot wallet is required. The user can choose any Ethereum-compatible wallet.

For demonstration purposes, we'll show how to configure [Metamask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} to work with your hardware wallet, but these steps are generally applicable to any other wallet that supports Ledger. To follow along with the steps, make sure you have Metamask installed in your browser, then open the extension and click on the dropdown icon next to the account name.

![Connect Ledger](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/ledger/ledger-2.webp)

Now click on the **+ Add account or hardware wallet** button.

![Connect Ledger](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/ledger/ledger-3.webp)

Select **Hardware wallet** from the available options.

![Connect Ledger](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/ledger/ledger-4.webp)

On the following screen:

1. Select the **LEDGER** box. You'll be prompted to connect your Ledger, unlock it, and open the Ethereum app.
2. Click on **Continue**.

![Connect Ledger](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/ledger/ledger-5.webp)

Finally, you will be presented with a list of derived accounts. Select the one you want to import, click **Unlock**, and that's all! Your Metamask wallet can now sign transactions using your Ledger device.

# Interacting with your Tanssi EVM Network Using MetaMask

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers building dApps on top of Tanssi-powered EVM networks can leverage their Ethereum compatibility features by integrating known Ethereum wallets, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}. By doing so, they can use the injected library MetaMask provides to interact with the Tanssi EVM network.

This guide takes you through all the necessary steps: from installing Metamask, to setting up a wallet, and finally connecting it to your Tanssi EVM network.

!!! note
    You should never share your seed phrase (mnemonic) or private key with anyone. This gives them direct access to your funds. This guide is for educational purposes only.

## Install the MetaMask Extension {: #install-the-metamask-extension }

First, you'll start with a fresh and default [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank} installation from the Chrome store. After downloading, installing, and initializing the extension, follow the **Get Started** steps to [setup the wallet](#setup-a-wallet). In there, you need to create a wallet, set a password, and store your secret backup phrase (this gives direct access to your funds, so make sure to store these in a secure place).

!!! note
    The Metamask browser extension is compatible with Chrome, Chromium based browsers (such as Microsoft Edge and Opera), and Firefox. Metamask is also available as a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

## Setup a Wallet {: #setup-a-wallet }

After installing [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, the setup will automatically open a new task with a welcome screen. Here, you are offered two options:

- **Create a new wallet** - you'll go through some steps to get a new seed phrase. Ensure you store this phrase securely and you don't share it publicly
- **Import an existing wallet** - you already have a seed phrase stored, and you want to restore an account from that recovery phrase

![Metamask Setup Interface](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-1.webp)

Once you've clicked on the option that adapts to your needs, follow the steps, and you should be all setup.

!!! note
    Multiple accounts can be derived from a seed phrase by changing what is known as the address index. By default, when creating or importing an account from the seed phrase, you get the account with the address index 0. You can get the other indexes by just adding new accounts in the main Metamask screen.

## Import Accounts {: #import-accounts }

Once you've created a wallet or imported an existing one, you can also import any account into MetaMask if you hold the private keys.

For this example, you'll use private keys from the development account. Click the account switcher button to import an account using its private keys. That is where it says **Account 1**.

![Importing account from private key metamask menu](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-2.webp)

Next, click on **Import Account**.

![Importing account from private key account switcher menu](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-3.webp)

Finally, enter the private keys of the account you are trying to import. Once you've entered the private key, click on **Import**.

![Paste your account key into MetaMask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-4.webp)

You should end up with an imported **Account 2** that looks like this:

![MetaMask displaying your new Account 2](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-5.webp)

## Connect MetaMask to your Tanssi EVM Network {: #connect-metamask-to-evm-network }

Once you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank} installed and have created or imported an account, you can connect it to your Tanssi EVM network. To do so, take the following steps:

1. Click in the upper left network selector menu
2. Select **Add Network**

![Add new network in Metamask menu](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-6.webp)

Next, go to the bottom of the page and click on **Add network manually**:

![Add network manually in Metamask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-7.webp)

Here, you can configure MetaMask for the following networks:

|         Variable          |                        Value                        |
|:-------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
|       Network Name        |             `Tanssi demo EVM appchain`              |
|          RPC URL          |    `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}`     |
|         Chain ID          |    `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}`    |
|     Symbol (Optional)     |  `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`  |
| Block Explorer (Optional) | `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}` |

To do so, fill in the following information:

1. **Network name** - name that represents the network you are connecting to
2. **RPC URL** - RPC endpoint of the network
3. **Chain ID** - chain ID of the Ethereum compatible network
4. **Symbol** - (optional) symbol of the native token of the network
5. **Block Explorer** - (optional) URL of the block explorer
6. Once you've verified all the information, click on **Save**

![Add network in Metamask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-8.webp)

Once you've added the network, you'll be redirected to a screen stating that you've successfully added a network. Furthermore, you'll be prompted to **Switch to Tanssi demo EVM appchain**, the network added in this example.

![Successfully added a network in Metamask](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/metamask-9.webp)

## Interact with the Network {: #interact-with-network }

Once you've [connected Metamask](#connect-metamask-to-evm-network) to your Tanssi EVM network, you can start using your wallet by:

- Requesting {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} tokens from the [demo EVM network faucet](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/#faucet)
- Sending a token transfer to another address
- Adding ERC-20s to Metamask and interacting with them
- Adding ERC-721s to Metamask and interacting with them

# Interacting with Your Tanssi EVM Network Using SubWallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Developers and users of Tanssi-powered EVM networks have a variety of options when it comes to wallets. Thanks to their seamless Ethereum compatibility, Tanssi EVM networks support a great variety of popular wallets, including SubWallet.

SubWallet is a comprehensive Web3 wallet that natively supports Substrate (Polkadot) and Ethereum accounts. This tutorial centers on the Ethereum API, but you can check out a similar [tutorial for interacting with SubWallet using the Substrate API](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/subwallet/){target=\_blank}. The SubWallet wallet browser extension [can be downloaded](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html){target=\_blank} for all supported browsers, including Chrome, Brave, Firefox, and MS Edge. SubWallet also has a mobile app for both iOS and Android, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. A complete online asset dashboard is accessible at [web.subwallet.app](https://web.subwallet.app){target=\_blank}.

This guide takes you through all the necessary steps, from installing SubWallet to setting up a wallet, connecting it to your Tanssi EVM network, and sending funds.

## Creating Your First Ethereum Account {: #creating-your-first-ethereum-account }

First, download and install the [SubWallet extension](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html){target=\_blank}. Creating a new account will generate a seed phrase that can derive multiple Ethereum and Substrate accounts. By default, SubWallet will generate a single Ethereum and a single Substrate account, but you can easily derive more from the same seed phrase. Click **Create a new account** to get started.

![Get started with SubWallet](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/subwallet/subwallet-1.webp)

# Indexing ERC-20 Transfers on a Tanssi EVM Network

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[SQD](https://www.sqd.ai/){target=\_blank} is a data network that allows rapid and cost-efficient retrieval of blockchain data from 100+ chains using SQD’s decentralized data lake and open-source SDK. In very simple terms, SQD can be thought of as an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org){target=\_blank} server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities.

SQD has native and full support for both EVM and Substrate data. SQD offers a Substrate Archive and Processor and an EVM Archive and Processor. The Substrate Archive and Processor can be used to index both Substrate and EVM data. This allows developers to extract on-chain data from any Tanssi-powered network and process EVM logs as well as Substrate entities (events, extrinsics, and storage items) in one single project and serve the resulting data with one single GraphQL endpoint. If you exclusively want to index EVM data, it is recommended to use the EVM Archive and Processor.

This tutorial is a step-by-step guide to building a Squid to index EVM data from start to finish. It's recommended that you follow along, taking each step described on your own, but you can also find a [complete version of the Squid built in this tutorial in the tanssiSquid GitHub repository](https://github.com/themacexpert/tanssiSquid){target=\_blank}.

## Check Prerequisites {: #check-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need to have:

- [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank}
- [Docker Compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install){target=\_blank}
- An empty Hardhat project. For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the [Creating a Hardhat Project](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/#creating-a-hardhat-project){target=\_blank} section of our Hardhat documentation page

!!! note
    The examples in this guide are based on a MacOS or Ubuntu 20.04 environment. If you're using Windows, you'll need to adapt them accordingly.
    
    Furthermore, please ensure that you have Node.js and a package manager (such as npm or yarn) installed. To learn how to install Node.js, please check their [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\blank}.
    
    Also, make sure you've initialized a `package.json` file for ES6 modules. You can initialize a default `package.json` file using npm by running the following command `npm init --yes`.

## Deploy an ERC-20 with Hardhat {: #deploy-an-erc20-with-hardhat }

Before we can index anything with SQD we need to make sure we have something to index! This section will walk through deploying an ERC-20 token to your Tanssi-powered network so you can get started indexing it. However, you can feel free to skip to [Create a Squid Project](#create-a-squid-project) if either of the two scenarios apply:

- You have already deployed an ERC-20 token to your network (and made several transfers)
- You would prefer to use an existing ERC-20 token deployed to the demo EVM network (of which there are already several transfer events)

If you'd like to use an existing ERC-20 token on the demo EVM network, you can use the below `MyTok.sol` contract. The hashes of the token transfers are provided as well to assist with any debugging.

In this section, we'll show you how to deploy an ERC-20 to your EVM network and we'll write a quick script to fire off a series of transfers that will be picked up by our SQD indexer. Ensure that you have initialized an empty Hardhat project via the instructions in the [Creating a Hardhat Project](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/#creating-a-hardhat-project){target=\_blank} section of our Hardhat documentation page.

Before we dive into creating our project, let's install a couple of dependencies that we'll need: the [Hardhat Ethers plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-ethers){target=\_blank} and [OpenZeppelin contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x){target=\_blank}. The Hardhat Ethers plugin provides a convenient way to use the [Ethers](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} library to interact with the network. We'll use OpenZeppelin's base ERC-20 implementation to create an ERC-20. To install both of these dependencies, you can run:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

Now we can edit `hardhat.config.js` to include the following network and account configurations for our network. You can replace the demo EVM network values with the respective parameters for your own Tanssi-powered EVM network which can be found at [apps.tanssi.network](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}.

???+ code "hardhat.config.js"

    ```js
    // 1. Import the Ethers plugin required to interact with the contract
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers');

// 2. Add your private key that is funded with tokens of your Tanssi-powered network
// This is for example purposes only - **never store your private keys in a JavaScript file**
const privateKey = 'INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY';

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  // 3. Specify the Solidity version
  solidity: '0.8.20',
  networks: {
    // 4. Add the network specification for your Tanssi EVM network
    demo: {
      url: 'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001/',
      chainId: 5678, // Fill in the EVM ChainID for your Tanssi-powered network
      accounts: [privateKey],
    },
  },
};
    ```

!!! remember
    You should never store your private keys in a JavaScript or Python file. It is done in this tutorial for ease of demonstration only. You should always manage your private keys with a designated secret manager or similar service.

### Create an ERC-20 Contract {: #create-an-erc-20-contract }

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be creating a simple ERC-20 contract. We'll rely on OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 base implementation. We'll start by creating a file for the contract and naming it `MyTok.sol`:

```bash
mkdir -p contracts && touch contracts/MyTok.sol
```

Now we can edit the `MyTok.sol` file to include the following contract, which will mint an initial supply of MYTOKs and allow only the owner of the contract to mint additional tokens:

???+ code "MyTok.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyTok is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") Ownable(msg.sender) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 50000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
    ```

### Deploy an ERC-20 Contract {: #deploy-erc-20-contract }

Now that we have our contract set up, we can compile and deploy our contract.

To compile the contract, you can run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

![Compile contracts using Hardhat](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/sqd-1.webp)

This command will compile our contract and generate an `artifacts` directory containing the ABI of the contract.

To deploy our contract, we'll need to create a deployment script that deploys our ERC-20 contract and mints an initial supply of MYTOKs. We'll use Alith's account to deploy the contract, and we'll specify the initial supply to be 1000 MYTOK. The initial supply will be minted and sent to the contract owner, which is Alith.

Let's take the following steps to deploy our contract:

1. Create a directory and file for our script:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p scripts && touch scripts/deploy.js
    ```

2. In the `deploy.js` file, go ahead and add the following script:

    ???+ code "deploy.js"

        ```ts
        // scripts/deploy.js
const hre = require('hardhat');
require('@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers');

async function main() {
  // Get ERC-20 contract
  const MyTok = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyTok');

  // Define custom gas price and gas limit
  // This is a temporary stopgap solution to a bug
  const customGasPrice = 50000000000; // example for 50 gwei
  const customGasLimit = 5000000; // example gas limit

  // Deploy the contract providing a gas price and gas limit
  const myTok = await MyTok.deploy({
    gasPrice: customGasPrice,
    gasLimit: customGasLimit,
  });

  // Wait for the deployment
  await myTok.waitForDeployment();

  console.log(`Contract deployed to ${myTok.target}`);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
        ```

3. Run the script using the `dev` network configurations we set up in the `hardhat.config.js` file:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network demo
    ```

The address of the deployed contract should be printed to the terminal. Save the address, as we'll need it to interact with the contract in the following section.

### Transfer ERC-20s {: #transfer-erc-20s }

Since we'll be indexing `Transfer` events for our ERC-20, we'll need to send a few transactions that transfer some tokens from Alith's account to our other test accounts. We'll do this by creating a simple script that transfers 10 MYTOKs to Baltathar, Charleth, Dorothy, and Ethan. We'll take the following steps:

Create a new file script to send transactions:

```bash
touch scripts/transactions.js
```

In the `transactions.js` file, add the following script and insert the contract address of your deployed MyTok contract (output in the console in the prior step):

???+ code "transactions.js"

    ```ts
    // We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// You can also run a script with `npx hardhat run <script>`. If you do that, Hardhat
// will compile your contracts, add the Hardhat Runtime Environment's members to the
// global scope, and execute the script.
const hre = require('hardhat');

async function main() {
  // Get Contract ABI
  const MyTok = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyTok');

  // Define custom gas price and gas limit
  // Gas price is typically specified in 'wei' and gas limit is just a number
  // You can use Ethers.js utility functions to convert from gwei or ether if needed
  const customGasPrice = 50000000000; // example for 50 gwei
  const customGasLimit = 5000000; // example gas limit

  // Plug ABI to address
  const myTok = await MyTok.attach('INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS');

  const value = 100000000000000000n;

  let tx;
  // Transfer to Baltathar
  tx = await myTok.transfer(
    '0x3Cd0A705a2DC65e5b1E1205896BaA2be8A07c6e0',
    value,
    {
      gasPrice: customGasPrice,
      gasLimit: customGasLimit,
    }
  );
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transfer to Baltathar with TxHash ${tx.hash}`);

  // Transfer to Charleth
  tx = await myTok.transfer(
    '0x798d4Ba9baf0064Ec19eB4F0a1a45785ae9D6DFc',
    value,
    {
      gasPrice: customGasPrice,
      gasLimit: customGasLimit,
    }
  );
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transfer to Charleth with TxHash ${tx.hash}`);

  // Transfer to Dorothy
  tx = await myTok.transfer(
    '0x773539d4Ac0e786233D90A233654ccEE26a613D9',
    value,
    {
      gasPrice: customGasPrice,
      gasLimit: customGasLimit,
    }
  );
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transfer to Dorothy with TxHash ${tx.hash}`);

  // Transfer to Ethan
  tx = await myTok.transfer(
    '0xFf64d3F6efE2317EE2807d223a0Bdc4c0c49dfDB',
    value,
    {
      gasPrice: customGasPrice,
      gasLimit: customGasLimit,
    }
  );
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Transfer to Ethan with TxHash ${tx.hash}`);
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
    ```

Run the script to send the transactions:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/transactions.js --network demo
```

As each transaction is sent, you'll see a log printed to the terminal.

![Send transactions using Hardhat](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/sqd-2.webp)

Now we can move on to creating our Squid to index the data on our local development node.

## Create a Squid Project {: #create-a-squid-project }

Now we're going to create our Subquid project. First, we'll need to install the [Squid CLI](https://docs.sqd.ai/squid-cli/){target=\_blank}:

```bash
npm i -g @subsquid/cli@latest
```

To verify successful installation, you can run:

```bash
sqd --version
```

Now we'll be able to use the `sqd` command to interact with our Squid project. To create our project, we're going to use the `--template` (`-t`) flag, which will create a project from a template. We'll be using the EVM Squid template, which is a starter project for indexing EVM chains.

You can run the following command to create an EVM Squid named `tanssi-squid`:

```bash
sqd init tanssi-squid --template evm
```

This will create a Squid with all of the necessary dependencies. You can go ahead and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd tanssi-squid && npm ci
```

Now that we have a starting point for our project, we'll need to configure our project to index ERC-20 `Transfer` events taking place on our Tanssi network.

##  Set Up the Indexer for ERC-20 Transfers {: #set-up-the-indexer-for-erc-20-transfers}

In order to index ERC-20 transfers, we'll need to take a series of actions:

1. Define the database schema and generate the entity classes
2. Use the `ERC20` contract's ABI to generate TypeScript interface classes
3. Configure the processor by specifying exactly what data to ingest
4. Transform the data and insert it into a TypeORM database in `main.ts`
5. Run the indexer and query the squid

As mentioned, we'll first need to define the database schema for the transfer data. To do so, we'll edit the `schema.graphql` file, which is located in the root directory, and create a `Transfer` entity and `Account` entity. You can copy and paste the below schema, ensuring that any existing schema is first removed.

???+ code "schema.graphql"

    ```graphql
    type Account @entity {
  "Account address"
  id: ID!
  transfersFrom: [Transfer!] @derivedFrom(field: "from")
  transfersTo: [Transfer!] @derivedFrom(field: "to")
}

type Transfer @entity {
  id: ID!
  blockNumber: Int!
  timestamp: DateTime!
  txHash: String!
  from: Account!
  to: Account!
  amount: BigInt!
}
    ```

Now we can generate the entity classes from the schema, which we'll use when we process the transfer data. This will create new classes for each entity in the `src/model/generated` directory.

```bash
sqd codegen
```

In the next step, we'll use the ERC-20 ABI to automatically generate TypeScript interface classes. Below is a generic ERC-20 standard ABI. Copy and paste it into a file named `erc20.json` in the `abi` folder at the root level of the project.

      }
    ],
    "name": "Transfer",
    "type": "event"
  }
]
    ```

Next, we can use our contract's ABI to generate TypeScript interface classes. We can do this by running:

```bash
sqd typegen
```

![Run Squid commands](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/sqd-3.webp)

This will generate the related TypeScript interface classes in the `src/abi/erc20.ts` file. For this tutorial, we'll be accessing the `events` specifically.

### Configure the Processor {: #configure-the-processor}

The `processor.ts` file tells SQD exactly what data you'd like to ingest. Transforming that data into the exact desired format will take place at a later step. In `processor.ts`, we'll need to indicate a data source, a contract address, the event(s) to index, and a block range.

Open up the `src` folder and head to the `processor.ts` file. First, we need to tell the SQD processor which contract we're interested in. Create a constant for the address in the following manner:

```ts
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();
```

The `.toLowerCase()` is critical because the SQD processor is case-sensitive, and some block explorers format contract addresses with capitalization. Next, you'll see the line `export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()`, followed by `.setDataSource`. We'll need to make a few changes here. SQD has [available archives for many chains](https://docs.sqd.ai/subsquid-network/reference/networks/){target=\_blank} that can speed up the data retrieval process, but it's unlikely your network has a hosted archive already. But not to worry, SQD can easily get the data it needs via your network's RPC URL. Go ahead and comment out or delete the archive line. Once done, your code should look similar to the below:

```ts
.setDataSource({
  chain: {
    url: assertNotNull(
      '{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}'
    ),
    rateLimit: 300,
  },
})
```

The Squid template comes with a variable for your RPC URL defined in your `.env` file. You can replace that with the RPC URL for your network. For demonstration purposes, the RPC URL for the demo EVM network is hardcoded directly, as shown above. If you're setting the RPC URL in your `.env`, the respective line will look like this:

```text
RPC_ENDPOINT={{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
```

Now, let's define the event that we want to index by adding the following:

```ts
.addLog({
  address: [contractAddress],
  topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],
  transaction: true,
})
```

The `Transfer` event is defined in `erc20.ts`, which was auto-generated when `sqd typegen` was run. The import `import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20'` is already included as part of the Squid EVM template.

Block range is an important value to modify to narrow the scope of the blocks you're indexing. For example, if you launched your ERC-20 at block `650000`, there is no need to query the chain before that block for transfer events. Setting an accurate block range will improve the performance of your indexer. You can set the earliest block to begin indexing in the following manner:

```ts
.setBlockRange({from: 632400,})
```

The chosen start block here corresponds to the relevant block to begin indexing on the demo EVM network, but you should change it to one relevant to your Tanssi-powered network and indexer project.

Change the `setFields` section to specify the following data for our processor to ingest:

```ts
.setFields({
  log: {
    topics: true,
    data: true,
  },
  transaction: {
    hash: true,
  },
})
```

We also need to add the following imports to our `processor.ts` file:

```ts
import { Store } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';
import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';
```

Once you've completed the prior steps, your `processor.ts` file should look similar to this:

???+ code "processor.ts"

    ```ts
    import { assertNotNull } from '@subsquid/util-internal';
import {
  BlockHeader,
  DataHandlerContext,
  EvmBatchProcessor,
  EvmBatchProcessorFields,
  Log as _Log,
  Transaction as _Transaction,
} from '@subsquid/evm-processor';
import { Store } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';
import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';

// Here you'll need to import the contract
export const contractAddress = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS'.toLowerCase();

export const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    chain: {
      url: assertNotNull(
        'https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'
      ),
      rateLimit: 300,
    },
  })
  .setFinalityConfirmation(10)
  .setFields({
    log: {
      topics: true,
      data: true,
    },
    transaction: {
      hash: true,
    },
  })
  .addLog({
    address: [contractAddress],
    topic0: [erc20.events.Transfer.topic],
    transaction: true,
  })
  .setBlockRange({
    from: INSERT_START_BLOCK, // Note the lack of quotes here
  });

export type Fields = EvmBatchProcessorFields<typeof processor>;
export type Block = BlockHeader<Fields>;
export type Log = _Log<Fields>;
export type Transaction = _Transaction<Fields>;
    ```

### Transform and Save the Data {: #transform-and-save-the-data}

While `processor.ts` determines the data being consumed, `main.ts` determines the bulk of actions related to processing and transforming that data. In the simplest terms, we are processing the data that was ingested via the SQD processor and inserting the desired pieces into a TypeORM database. For more detailed information on how SQD works, be sure to check out the [SQD docs on Developing a Squid](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/){target=\_blank}.

Our `main.ts` file is going to scan through each processed block for the `Transfer` event and decode the transfer details, including the sender, receiver, and amount. The script also fetches account details for involved addresses and creates transfer objects with the extracted data. The script then inserts these records into a TypeORM database, enabling them to be easily queried. Let's break down the code that comprises `main.ts` in order:

1. The job of `main.ts` is to run the processor and refine the collected data. In `processor.run`, the processor will iterate through all selected blocks and look for `Transfer` event logs. Whenever it finds a `Transfer` event, it's going to store it in an array of transfer events where it awaits further processing
2. The `transferEvent` interface is the type of structure that stores the data extracted from the event logs
3. `getTransfer` is a helper function that extracts and decodes ERC-20 `Transfer` event data from a log entry. It constructs and returns a `TransferEvent` object, which includes details such as the transaction ID, block number, sender and receiver addresses, and the amount transferred. `getTransfer` is called at the time of storing the relevant transfer events into the array of transfers
4. `processTransfers` enriches the transfer data and then inserts these records into a TypeORM database using the `ctx.store` methods. The account model, while not strictly necessary, allows us to introduce another entity in the schema to demonstrate working with multiple entities in your Squid
5. `getAccount` is a helper function that manages the retrieval and creation of account objects. Given an account ID and a map of existing accounts, it returns the corresponding account object. If the account doesn't exist in the map, it creates a new one, adds it to the map, and then returns it

We'll demo a sample query in a later section. You can copy and paste the below code into your `main.ts` file:

???+ code "main.ts"

    ```ts
    import { In } from 'typeorm';
import { assertNotNull } from '@subsquid/evm-processor';
import { TypeormDatabase } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';
import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';
import { Account, Transfer } from './model';
import {
  Block,
  contractAddress,
  Log,
  Transaction,
  processor,
} from './processor';

// 1. Iterate through all selected blocks and look for transfer events,
// storing the relevant events in an array of transfer events
processor.run(new TypeormDatabase({ supportHotBlocks: true }), async (ctx) => {
  let transfers: TransferEvent[] = [];

  for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
    for (let log of block.logs) {
      if (
        log.address === contractAddress &&
        log.topics[0] === erc20.events.Transfer.topic
      ) {
        transfers.push(getTransfer(ctx, log));
      }
    }
  }

  await processTransfers(ctx, transfers);
});

// 2. Define an interface to hold the data from the transfer events
interface TransferEvent {
  id: string;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  amount: bigint;
}

// 3. Extract and decode ERC-20 transfer event data from a log entry
function getTransfer(ctx: any, log: Log): TransferEvent {
  let event = erc20.events.Transfer.decode(log);

  let from = event.from.toLowerCase();
  let to = event.to.toLowerCase();
  let amount = event.value;

  let transaction = assertNotNull(log.transaction, `Missing transaction`);

  return {
    id: log.id,
    block: log.block,
    transaction,
    from,
    to,
    amount,
  };
}

// 4. Enrich and insert data into typeorm database
async function processTransfers(ctx: any, transfersData: TransferEvent[]) {
  let accountIds = new Set<string>();
  for (let t of transfersData) {
    accountIds.add(t.from);
    accountIds.add(t.to);
  }

  let accounts = await ctx.store
    .findBy(Account, { id: In([...accountIds]) })
    .then((q: any[]) => new Map(q.map((i: any) => [i.id, i])));

  let transfers: Transfer[] = [];

  for (let t of transfersData) {
    let { id, block, transaction, amount } = t;

    let from = getAccount(accounts, t.from);
    let to = getAccount(accounts, t.to);

    transfers.push(
      new Transfer({
        id,
        blockNumber: block.height,
        timestamp: new Date(block.timestamp),
        txHash: transaction.hash,
        from,
        to,
        amount,
      })
    );
  }

  await ctx.store.upsert(Array.from(accounts.values()));
  await ctx.store.insert(transfers);
}

// 5. Helper function to get account object
function getAccount(m: Map<string, Account>, id: string): Account {
  let acc = m.get(id);
  if (acc == null) {
    acc = new Account();
    acc.id = id;
    m.set(id, acc);
  }
  return acc;
}
    ```

Now we've taken all of the steps necessary and are ready to run our indexer!

### Run the Indexer {: #run-the-indexer }

To run our indexer, we're going to run a series of `sqd` commands:

Build our project:

   ```bash
   sqd build
   ```

Launch the database:

   ```bash
   sqd up
   ```

Remove the database migration file that comes with the EVM template and generate a new one for our new database schema:

   ```bash
   sqd migration:generate
   ```

   ```bash
   sqd migration:apply
   ```

Launch the processor:

   ```bash
   sqd process
   ```

In your terminal, you should see your indexer starting to process blocks!

![Get Squid running](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/sqd-4.webp)

## Query Your Squid {: #query-your-squid }

To query your squid, open up a new terminal window within your project and run the following command:

```bash
sqd serve
```

And that's it! You can now run queries against your Squid on the GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:4350/graphql`. Try crafting your own GraphQL query, or use the below one:

???+ code "Example query"

    ```ts
    query {
  accounts {
    id
    transfersFrom {
      id
      blockNumber
      timestamp
      txHash
      to {
        id
      }
      amount
    }
    transfersTo {
      id
      blockNumber
      timestamp
      txHash
      from {
        id
      }
      amount
    }
  }
}
    ```

![Running queries in GraphQL playground](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/sqd-5.webp)

## Debug Your Squid {: #debug-your-squid }

It may seem tricky at first to debug errors when building your Squid, but fortunately, there are several techniques you can use to streamline this process. First and foremost, if you're facing errors with your Squid, you should enable debug mode in your `.env` file by uncommenting the debug mode line. This will trigger much more verbose logging and will help you locate the source of the error.

```text
# Uncommenting the below line enables debug mode
SQD_DEBUG=*
```

You can also add logging statements directly to your `main.ts` file to indicate specific parameters like block height and more. For example, see this version of `main.ts`, which has been enhanced with detailed logging:

??? code "main.ts"

    ```ts
    import { In } from 'typeorm';
import { assertNotNull } from '@subsquid/evm-processor';
import { TypeormDatabase } from '@subsquid/typeorm-store';
import * as erc20 from './abi/erc20';
import { Account, Transfer } from './model';
import {
  Block,
  contractAddress,
  Log,
  Transaction,
  processor,
} from './processor';

processor.run(new TypeormDatabase({ supportHotBlocks: true }), async (ctx) => {
  ctx.log.info('Processor started');
  let transfers: TransferEvent[] = [];

  ctx.log.info(`Processing ${ctx.blocks.length} blocks`);
  for (let block of ctx.blocks) {
    ctx.log.debug(`Processing block number ${block.header.height}`);
    for (let log of block.logs) {
      ctx.log.debug(`Processing log with address ${log.address}`);
      if (
        log.address === contractAddress &&
        log.topics[0] === erc20.events.Transfer.topic
      ) {
        ctx.log.info(`Transfer event found in block ${block.header.height}`);
        transfers.push(getTransfer(ctx, log));
      }
    }
  }

  ctx.log.info(`Found ${transfers.length} transfers, processing...`);
  await processTransfers(ctx, transfers);
  ctx.log.info('Processor finished');
});

interface TransferEvent {
  id: string;
  block: Block;
  transaction: Transaction;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  amount: bigint;
}

function getTransfer(ctx: any, log: Log): TransferEvent {
  let event = erc20.events.Transfer.decode(log);

  let from = event.from.toLowerCase();
  let to = event.to.toLowerCase();
  let amount = event.value;

  let transaction = assertNotNull(log.transaction, `Missing transaction`);

  ctx.log.debug(
    `Decoded transfer event: from ${from} to ${to} amount ${amount.toString()}`
  );
  return {
    id: log.id,
    block: log.block,
    transaction,
    from,
    to,
    amount,
  };
}

async function processTransfers(ctx: any, transfersData: TransferEvent[]) {
  ctx.log.info('Starting to process transfer data');
  let accountIds = new Set<string>();
  for (let t of transfersData) {
    accountIds.add(t.from);
    accountIds.add(t.to);
  }

  ctx.log.debug(`Fetching accounts for ${accountIds.size} addresses`);
  let accounts = await ctx.store
    .findBy(Account, { id: In([...accountIds]) })
    .then((q: any[]) => new Map(q.map((i: any) => [i.id, i])));
  ctx.log.info(
    `Accounts fetched, processing ${transfersData.length} transfers`
  );

  let transfers: Transfer[] = [];

  for (let t of transfersData) {
    let { id, block, transaction, amount } = t;

    let from = getAccount(accounts, t.from);
    let to = getAccount(accounts, t.to);

    transfers.push(
      new Transfer({
        id,
        blockNumber: block.height,
        timestamp: new Date(block.timestamp),
        txHash: transaction.hash,
        from,
        to,
        amount,
      })
    );
  }

  ctx.log.debug(`Upserting ${accounts.size} accounts`);
  await ctx.store.upsert(Array.from(accounts.values()));
  ctx.log.debug(`Inserting ${transfers.length} transfers`);
  await ctx.store.insert(transfers);
  ctx.log.info('Transfer data processing completed');
}

function getAccount(m: Map<string, Account>, id: string): Account {
  let acc = m.get(id);
  if (acc == null) {
    acc = new Account();
    acc.id = id;
    m.set(id, acc);
  }
  return acc;
}
    ```

See the [SQD guide to logging](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/reference/logger/){target=\_blank} for more information on debug mode.

### Common Errors {: #common-errors }

Below are some common errors you may face when building a project and how you can solve them.

```text
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint my-awesome-squid-db-1
(49df671a7b0531abbb5dc5d2a4a3f5dc7e7505af89bf0ad1e5480bd1cdc61052):
Bind for 0.0.0.0:23798 failed: port is already allocated
```

This error indicates that you have another instance of SQD running somewhere else. You can stop that gracefully with the command `sqd down` or by pressing the **Stop** button next to the container in Docker Desktop.

```text
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:23798
     at createConnectionError (node:net:1634:14)
     at afterConnectMultiple (node:net:1664:40) {
     errno: -61,code: 'ECONNREFUSED',syscall: 'connect',
     address: '127.0.0.1',port: 23798}
```

To resolve this, run `sqd up` before you run `sqd migration:generate`

Is your Squid error-free, yet you aren't seeing any transfers detected? Make sure your log events are consistent and identical to the ones your processor is looking for. Your contract address also needs to be lowercase, which you can be assured of by defining it as follows:

```ts
export const contractAddress = '0x37822de108AFFdd5cDCFDaAa2E32756Da284DB85'.toLowerCase();
```

# Indexing a Tanssi Network with SQD

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[SQD](https://www.sqd.ai/){target=\_blank} is a data network that allows rapid and cost-efficient retrieval of blockchain data from 100+ chains using SQD's decentralized data lake and open-source SDK. In simple terms, SQD can be thought of as an ETL (extract, transform, and load) tool with a GraphQL server included. It enables comprehensive filtering, pagination, and even full-text search capabilities. SQD has native and full support for both EVM and Substrate data, even within the same project.

This quick-start guide will show you how to create a Squid project and configure it to index data on a Tanssi-powered network. There is one section catered towards [Substrate networks](#index-substrate-networks) and another towards [EVM networks](#index-evm-networks). However, if you're building on an EVM network, you may also reference the Substrate section, if you also need to index Substrate data.

For a more comprehensive end-to-end tutorial for EVM networks, be sure to check out the [Indexing ERC-20 Transfers on a Tanssi EVM Network](/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/){target=\_blank} tutorial.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

For the examples in this guide, you will need to have the following:

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=\_blank} version 16 or newer
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){target=\_blank}
 - [Squid CLI](https://docs.sqd.ai/squid-cli/installation/){target=\_blank}

## Index a Tanssi Substrate Network {: #index-substrate-networks }

To get started indexing Substrate data on your Tanssi-powered network, you'll need to create a Squid project and configure it for your network by taking the following steps:

1. Create a Squid project based on the Substrate template by running

    ```bash
    sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template substrate
    ```

    For more information on getting started with this template, please check out the [Getting started: Substrate chains](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/?template-tech=substrate){target=\_blank} guide on SQD's documentation site.

2. Navigate into the root directory of your Squid project and install dependencies by running

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Modify the `src/processor.ts` file to set the data source to the RPC URL of your Tanssi network. Remove the `archive: lookupArchive` line as a Squid archive will not be used. Here, you'll need to specify the RPC URL of your Tanssi Substrate network, as the endpoint is used to ingest chain data

    ```ts
    const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor();
    processor.setDataSource({
      chain: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
    })
    ```

4. Launch Postgres by running

    ```bash
    sqd up
    ```

5. Inspect and run the processor

    ```bash
    sqd process
    ```

6. Open a separate terminal window in the same directory, then start the GraphQL server

    ```bash
    sqd serve
    ```

7. You can query your template Substrate Squid with the below sample query. If you've modified the template Substrate squid to index different data, you'll need to modify this query accordingly

    ```graphql
    query MyQuery {
      accountsConnection(orderBy: id_ASC) {
        totalCount
      }
    }
    ```

And that's all you have to do to configure your Squid project to index Substrate data on your Tanssi-powered Substrate network! Now you can update the `schema.graphql`, `src/main.ts`, `typegen.json`, and `src/processor.ts` files to index the data you need for your project!

## Index a Tanssi EVM Network {: #index-evm-networks }

To get started indexing EVM data on a Tanssi-powered EVM network, you'll need to create a Squid project and configure it for your network by taking the following steps:

1. You can create a Squid project for EVM data by using the generic [EVM template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-template){target=\_blank} or you can use the [ABI template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-abi-template){target=\_blank} for indexing data related to a specific contract

    === "EVM"

        ```bash
        sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template evm
        ```

    === "ABI"

        ```bash
        sqd init INSERT_SQUID_NAME --template abi
        ```

    For more information on getting started with both of these templates, please check out the following SQD docs:

      - [Getting started: EVM chains](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/?template-tech=evm){target=\_blank}
      - [Quickstart: Squid generation tools](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/resources/tools/squid-gen/){target=\_blank}

2. Navigate into the root directory of your Squid project and install dependencies by running

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. Modify the `src/processor.ts` file to set the data source to the RPC URL of your Tanssi network. Remove the `archive: lookupArchive('eth-mainnet')` line as a Squid archive will not be used. Here, the RPC URL of the demo EVM network is specified. The Squid project will use the RPC endpoint to ingest the relevant data

    ```ts
    const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor();
    processor.setDataSource({
      chain: 'INSERT_RPC_URL',
    })
    ```

    !!! note
        To try this out on the demo EVM network, you can use the following RPC URL:

        ```text
        {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
        ```

4. Launch Postgres by running

    ```bash
    sqd up
    ```

5. Inspect and run the processor

    ```bash
    sqd process
    ```

6. Open a separate terminal window in the same directory, then start the GraphQL server

    ```bash
    sqd serve
    ```

7. You can now run queries, such as the sample query below, against your Squid on the GraphQL playground at `http://localhost:4350/graphql`. If you've modified the template Substrate squid to index different data, you'll need to modify this query accordingly

    ```graphql
    query MyQuery {
      burns(orderBy: value_DESC) {
        address
        block
        id
        txHash
        value
      }
    }
    ```

And that's all you have to do to configure your Squid project to index EVM data on your Tanssi-powered EVM network! Now you can update the `schema.graphql`, `src/main.ts`, and `src/processor.ts` files to index the data you need for your project!

If you're interested in a more comprehensive step-by-step tutorial to get started indexing data for your Tanssi network, you can check out the [Indexing ERC-20 Transfers on a Tanssi EVM Network](/builders/toolkit/integrations/indexers/sqd/erc20-transfers/){target=\_blank} tutorial!

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Acurast](https://acurast.com){target=\_blank} gives developers complete permissionless access to compute that is trustless, affordable, and confidential for deploying their applications.

One of Acurast's use cases is to enable developers to deploy their own push/pull oracles, interacting with off-chain APIs to bring price feeds on-chain. Pricing data is confidentially processed through Acurast Processors, pushing data to smart contracts of EVM-compatible chains like Tanssi-powered EVM networks via a [standard Chainlink Aggregator Interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol){target=\_blank}.

This tutorial will walk through a demo of [interacting with price feeds](#fetch-price-data) enabled by Acurast on the [demo Tanssi EVM-compatible network](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/){target=\_blank}. You can also deploy your own price feeds to your Tanssi EVM-compatible network. Please be advised that the steps shown in this tutorial are for demonstration purposes only - it's highly recommended that you contact the [Acurast](https://acurast.com){target=\_blank} team directly as they can assist you with launching price feeds on your network to ensure the integrity of the deployment process.

## What is Acurast? {: #what-is-acurast }

Acurast is a decentralized, serverless cloud where everyone can become part of the cloud with their new, used, or even mobile phones with a smashed screen by providing compute power to the cloud and earning rewards. These so-called Processors are scattered across the globe, creating a distributed network of compute across the globe.

Processors and developers can seamlessly interact through the [Acurast Console](https://console.acurast.com){target=\_blank}.

## Fetch Price Data {: #fetch-price-data }

You can design your Acurast price feed exactly as you wish. The demo price feed built for this tutorial inherits the same interface as the Chainlink price feeds. The data lives in a series of smart contracts (one per price feed) and can be fetched with the aggregator interface:

???+ code "AggregatorV3Interface.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface AggregatorV3Interface {
    /**
     * Returns the decimals to offset on the getLatestPrice call
     */
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);

    /**
     * Returns the description of the underlying price feed aggregator
     */
    function description() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * Returns the version number representing the type of aggregator the proxy points to
     */
    function version() external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * Returns price data about a specific round
     */
    function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId) external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);

    /**
     * Returns price data from the latest round
     */
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);
}
    ```

As seen above in the interface, there are five functions for fetching data: `decimals`, `description`, `version`, `getRoundData`, and `latestRoundData`. For more information about the `AggregatorV3Interface.sol`, see the [Chainlink API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference){target=\_blank}.

## Interacting with Price Feeds on the Tanssi Demo EVM Network {: #interacting-with-price-feeds-demo-evm-network }

This tutorial will showcase interacting with a sample BTC/USDT price feed contract on the demo EVM network, but you can interact any of the price feeds listed in [Supported Assets](#supported-assets). The BTC/USDT price feed is [deployed on the demo EVM network]({{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}address/0x02093b190D9462d964C11587f7DedD92718D7B56){target=\_blank}, so you can interact with it by accessing the aggregator contract at the below contract address:

```text
{{ networks.demo_evm.oracles.acurast.btc_usd }}
```

For a refresher on setting up Remix to interface with the demo EVM network, see the [Deploy Smart Contracts with Remix](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide. Secondly, make sure you have [connected MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} to the demo EVM network.

Paste the [aggregator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol){target=\_blank} into a new file in Remix and compile it.

![Compile aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/acurast/acurast-1.webp)

Then, take the following steps:

1. Head to the **Deploy and Run Transactions** tab
2. Set the **ENVIRONMENT** to **Injected Provider -- MetaMask**
3. Select the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract from the **CONTRACT** dropdown
4. Enter the sample price feed contract address for `BTC to USD`, which is `{{ networks.demo_evm.oracles.acurast.btc_usd }}` on the demo EVM network in the **At Address** field and click the **At Address** button

![Access aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/acurast/acurast-2.webp)

The aggregator contract should now be accessible. To interact with the aggregator contract, take the following steps:

1. Expand the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract to reveal the available functions
2. Click **decimals** to query how many digits after the decimal point are included in the returned price data
3. Click **description** to verify the asset pair of the price feed
4. Click **latestRoundData** to see the most recent price data for the asset pair. The price data for the pair is returned as the **int256 answer**

![Check price data](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/acurast/acurast-3.webp)

Note that to obtain a readable price from the price feed, it's essential to adjust for the feed's decimal places, which can be determined using the `decimals()` method. For instance, if the price feed returns a value of `51933620000`, you'll need to move the decimal point six places to accurately reflect the price. In this example, it corresponds to a Bitcoin price of `$51,933.62` at the time of writing.

### Supported Assets {: #supported-assets }

By its design, Acurast can support the price feed of any arbitrary asset that is accessible by an API. The API request that powers the demo price feed is as follows:

```bash
curl "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT"
```

Upon running the above command in your terminal, you'll see a result that resembles the following:

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>curl "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT" </span>
  <span data-ty> </span>
  <span data-ty>{"symbol":"BTCUSDT","price":"51917.61000000"}</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span> </span>
</div>

!!! note
    This simple example of fetching a price feed relies on a single source of price feed data from one exchange. You can build a more complex job script that aggregates pricing data from multiple sources.

The Acurast team has deployed the below price feeds on the Tanssi demo EVM network:

| Asset & Base Pair |                                                                           Aggregator Contract                                                                           |

## Designing and Launching Your Own Price Feed {: #designing-and-launching-your-own-price-feed }

You can build and launch your own Acurast price feed on your Tanssi-powered EVM-compatible network. Please be advised that the steps shown in this tutorial are unaudited, unverified, and for demonstration purposes only - it's highly recommended that you [contact the Acurast team directly](https://acurast.com){target=\_blank} as they can assist you with launching price feeds on your network to ensure the integrity of the deployment process.

To launch an Acurast price feed, you need two key components: a smart contract and a script. In the prior example of [Interacting with the BTC/USD price feed](#interacting-with-price-feeds-demo-evm-network) on the demo EVM network, the generic Chainlink interface is used because it is a more straightforward example for demonstration purposes. The underlying smart contract that powers that price feed conforms to the [Chainlink Aggregator interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol){target=\_blank}, but the demo contract has additional components worthy of discussion. You can find both the demo contract and script at the [GitHub repo for the Acurast demo BTC/USD price feed](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-evm-oracle-sample/tree/main){target=\_blank}.

The demo contract, `InsecureDummyPriceFeed.sol`, emits an event when the price is updated and when a new round begins. The `setPrice` method is insecure, as shown in this demo smart contract, but it is provided to show you where you might add logic like aggregation consensus, access control checks, and other parameters.

???+ code "InsecureDummyPriceFeed.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./interfaces/chainlink/AggregatorV2V3Interface.sol";

/**
This Dummy Oracle is compatible with Chainlink's AggregatorV2V3Interface, meaning projects currently using
Chainlink can seamlessly migrate. The updating of the price feed happens in the interval you specified on
the Acurast script.

At the moment no check on the signer/source is being performed, making this implementation INSECURE. However
with a minimal effort you can extend the "setPrice" entrypoint to reflext the kind of logic you are looking for
(i.e. Aggregation Consensus, Check sources, thresholds, etc).
**/

contract DummyChainlinkCompatibleOracle is AggregatorV2V3Interface {
    int256 private latestPrice;
    uint256 private latestPriceTimestamp;
    uint256 private latestRoundId;

    // Assuming price can be set without restriction for simplicity
    // In a real-world scenario, there should be access control mechanisms
    function setPrice(int256 _price) external {
        latestPrice = _price;
        latestPriceTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        latestRoundId++;

        emit AnswerUpdated(latestPrice, latestRoundId, latestPriceTimestamp);
        emit NewRound(latestRoundId, msg.sender, latestPriceTimestamp);
    }

    // AggregatorInterface functions
    function latestAnswer() external view override returns (int256) {
        return latestPrice;
    }

    }

    function latestRound() external view override returns (uint256) {
        return latestRoundId;
    }

    function getAnswer(uint256 _roundId) external view override returns (int256) {
        if(_roundId == latestRoundId) {
            return latestPrice;
        }
        return 0; // Simplification, should handle historical data
    }

    function getTimestamp(uint256 _roundId) external view override returns (uint256) {
        if(_roundId == latestRoundId) {
            return latestPriceTimestamp;
        }
        return 0; // Simplification, should handle historical data
    }

    // AggregatorV3Interface functions
    function decimals() external pure override returns (uint8) {
        return 6; // Assume a common decimal value for simplicity
    }

    function description() external pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Sample Price Feed";
    }

    function version() external pure override returns (uint256) {
        return 1;
    }

    function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId)
        external
        view
        override
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        require(_roundId == latestRoundId, "Only latest round data available");
        return (uint80(latestRoundId), latestPrice, latestPriceTimestamp, latestPriceTimestamp, uint80(latestRoundId));
    }

    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        override
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        )
    {
        return (uint80(latestRoundId), latestPrice, latestPriceTimestamp, latestPriceTimestamp, uint80(latestRoundId));
    }
}
    ```

!!! warning
    This demo contract has some security vulnerabilities and lacks access control mechanisms, making it unsuitable for any real use. It was developed by the Acurast team for demonstration purposes only.

Before proceeding to the next steps, you must first deploy your price feed's smart contract on your Tanssi EVM network. Or, you can deploy it to the [demo EVM network](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/), and you can obtain TestNet {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} tokens from the [Tanssi faucet](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}. Once deployed, be sure to record the contract address, as you will need to enter this information into your Acurast price feed script.

### Building the Acurast Script

The Acurast oracle script plays a crucial role by updating your on-chain oracle with fresh data, acting as the vital connection between the Tanssi network's price feed and the Acurast network. Through the Acurast console, you will upload this script and specify all necessary parameters for your price feed's operation, including its frequency, schedule, and rewards for Acurast processors, among others. To facilitate this process, you will need cACU tokens, which are available from the [faucet](https://faucet.acurast.com){target=\_blank}, and serve as the native currency of the Acurast Canary network.

The [Acurast script for the demo BTC/USD price feed](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-evm-oracle-sample/blob/main/acurast_scripts/oracle_job.js){target=\_blank} can be used as a basis for creating your own script. Remember to update the contract address and RPC URL fields.

???+ code "AcurastScript.js"

    ```js
    /**
 * This Oracle Script observes the BTC USDT Pair and posts the price on-chain.
 * Deploying the script is easy using console.acurast.com and simply copy/pasting
 * this script. Make sure to update `DESTINATION_CONTRACT` and `EVM_RPC_NODE` to
 * reflect your deployment. For RPC's with API keys like i.e. infura make sure
 * to work with the Acurast confidential environment variables. After having set
 * them for your job, you can access them easily with a `_STD_.env["MY_KEY"]`. They
 * also come in handy for paid API KEYs, that you don't want to share publicly.
 */

const DESTINATION_CONTRACT = 'INSERT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const EVM_RPC_NODE = 'INSERT_NETWORK_RPC_URL';

httpGET(
  'https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BTCUSDT',
  {},
  (response, certificate) => {

    ) {
      //const price = BigInt(JSON.parse(response)["price"] * 10 ** 18); // if you need more precision, just keep in mind that JS stored bigger numbers in float format, rounding up/down your stuff.
      const price = BigInt(JSON.parse(response)['price'] * 10 ** 6);
      const int256AsBytes = '0x' + price.toString(16).padStart(64, '0');
      const payload = '0x' + _STD_.chains.ethereum.abi.encode(int256AsBytes);
      _STD_.chains.ethereum.fulfill(
        EVM_RPC_NODE,
        DESTINATION_CONTRACT,
        payload,

# Accessing Price Feeds with the Band Protocol

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Band Protocol](https://www.bandprotocol.com/){target=\_blank} is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable, secure, real-time data to smart contracts on various blockchain networks.

The protocol is built on top of BandChain, a network designed to be compatible with most EVM-compatible chains, such as Tanssi-powered EVM networks, and blockchain development frameworks. The protocol aims to provide a solution that is:

- Decentralized, leveraging the computational power of a network of validators
- Flexible, supporting a wide range of data sources and formats, making integrations easy
- Scalable, designed to handle high volumes of data requests
- Affordable, allowing users to request data only when they need to and pay the associated fees

To deploy the oracle onto your network, reach out to the [Band Protocol](https://www.bandprotocol.com/){target=\_blank} team directly.

This tutorial will walk through the steps to interact with price feeds using the Band protocol's oracle on the [Tanssi demo EVM-compatible network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}. 

## Setup on the Tanssi Demo EVM Network {: #setup-on-demo-evm-network }

The Band Protocol oracle is already deployed on the Tanssi demo EVM network and configured to provide prices for the `ETH` and `DOT` tokens.

The price feeds are pushed regularly to a smart contract that is accessible at the following address:

```text
{{ networks.demo_evm.oracles.band.smart_contract }}
```

The smart can be interacted with using the interface:

???+ code "IStdReference.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

pragma solidity 0.8.26;

interface IStdReference {
    /// A structure returned whenever someone requests for standard reference data.
    struct ReferenceData {
        uint256 rate; // base/quote exchange rate, multiplied by 1e18.
        uint256 lastUpdatedBase; // UNIX epoch of the last time when base price gets updated.
        uint256 lastUpdatedQuote; // UNIX epoch of the last time when quote price gets updated.
    } 

    /// Returns the price data for the given base/quote pair. Revert if not available.
    function getReferenceData(string memory _base, string memory _quote) external view returns (ReferenceData memory);

    /// Similar to getReferenceData, but with multiple base/quote pairs at once.
    function getReferenceDataBulk(string[] memory _bases, string[] memory _quotes) external view returns (ReferenceData[] memory);
}
    ```

As seen above in the interface, there are two functions for fetching data:

???+ function "**getReferenceData**(_base, _quote) — fetches the price for a given base/quote pair"

    === "Parameters"

        - `_base` ++"string memory"++ - the token you want to get the price for
        - `_quote` ++"string memory"++ - the token (or `USD`) in which the price is expressed
        
    === "Example"

        - `_base` - ETH
        - `_quote` - USD
        
??? function "**getReferenceDataBulk**(_bases, _quotes) — fetches prices for the given base/quote pairs simultaneously"

    === "Parameters"

        - `_bases` ++"string[] memory"++ - the list of base tokens you want to get the prices for
        - `_quotes` ++"string[] memory"++ - the list of tokens (or `USD`) in which the prices are expressed

    === "Example"

        - `_bases` - ["ETH", "DOT"]
        - `_quotes` - ["USD", "USD"]

The response for both functions consists of the following data, grouped in one tuple in the case of `getReferenceData` and one list of tuples (one tuple per pair) in the case of `getReferenceDataBulk`:

- `rate` ++"uint256"++ - price for the given base/quote pair. Note that the result must be adjusted to consider eighteen decimal places
- `lastUpdatedBase` ++"uint256"++ - update timestamp for the `_base` parameter, expressed in UNIX epochs, which is the number of seconds that have passed since `01-01-1970 00:00:00 UT`
- `lastUpdatedQuote` ++"uint256"++ - update timestamp for the `_quote` parameter, expressed in UNIX epochs, which is the number of seconds that have passed since `01-01-1970 00:00:00 UT`

### Fetching Price Feeds Using Remix {: #fetching-price-feeds-remix }

In this section, we'll use remix to fetch the price of the pair `ETH/USD`. 

First, make sure you have an [EVM-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/){target=\_blank} connected to the [demo EVM network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}. [MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} is used as an example in this guide. Now, head to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/){target=\_blank}, paste the [`IStdReference`](#setup-on-demo-evm-network) interface into a new file, and compile it.

![Compile interface contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/band/band-1.webp)

Then, take the following steps:

1. Head to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab
2. Set the **ENVIRONMENT** to **Injected Provider -- MetaMask**
3. Select the `IStdReference.sol` contract from the **CONTRACT** dropdown
4. Enter the data feed contract address, which is `{{ networks.demo_evm.oracles.band.smart_contract }}` on the demo EVM network in the **At Address** field and click the **At Address** button

![Access Interface contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/band/band-2.webp)

The contract should now be accessible. To interact with it, take the following steps:

1. Expand the **IStdReference** contract to reveal the available functions
2. Expand **getReferenceData**, and set the `_base` and `_quote` input parameters to `ETH` and `USD`, respectively
3. Click **Call**
4. The result will show three values: the price, update time for the `_base` parameter, and update time for the `_quote` parameter

![Check price data](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/band/band-3.webp)

Note that to obtain a readable price from the price feed, it's essential to adjust for the feed's decimal places, which are eighteen. For instance, the example above shows a value of `2361167929271984201806`, corresponding to an `ETH` price of `$2,361.167929271984201806` expressed in `USD`. Also, note that the update timestamp values are expressed in UNIX epoch time, expressed as the number of seconds that have passed since `01-01-1970 00:00:00 UT`.

# Launching Price Feeds with Phala

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Phala Network](https://phala.com/){target=\_blank} is an off-chain compute network powered by [Secure Enclaves](https://docs.phala.com/network/tech-specs/blockchain/overview#the-architecture){target=\_blank} that enables developers to build powerful smart contracts that connect to off-chain components called Phat Contracts. Phat Contracts are designed to enable functionality that surpasses the limitations of traditional smart contracts, such as storage, cost, and compute limitations while remaining trustless, verifiable, and permissionless. For more information about Phala's architecture, be sure to check out the [Phala docs](https://docs.phala.com/overview/phala-network){target=\_blank}.

Phala is not an oracle network itself; rather, Phala enables a variety of off-chain compute capabilities, such as a decentralized oracle network. Phala also provides a toolset called [Phala Bricks](https://bricks.phala.network){target=\_blank} that makes it easy to quickly launch these types of features without having to build them from scratch.

This tutorial will walk through a demo of [interacting with price feeds](#fetch-price-data) enabled by Phat contracts on the demo Tanssi-powered EVM-compatible network. Next, you'll learn how to [deploy price feeds to your Tanssi EVM-compatible network](#launching-price-feeds-on-an-evm-network). Please be advised that the steps shown in this tutorial are for demonstration purposes only - it's highly recommended that you [contact the Phala team directly](https://dashboard.phala.network){target=\_blank} as they can assist you with launching price feeds on a network to ensure the integrity of the deployment process.

## How Phala Enables Price Feeds {: #how-phala-enables-price-feeds }

Phala mirrors [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds){target=\_blank} from Ethereum MainNet. Chainlink Price Feeds have stood the test of time and have wide industry adoption. As a reminder, Chainlink Price Feeds don't rely on any single source of truth, rather, their pricing data is collected and aggregated from a variety of data sources gathered by a decentralized set of independent node operators. This helps to prevent manipulation and erratic pricing data.

The core component of Phala's system design is the [Secure Enclave](https://docs.phala.com/network/tech-specs/blockchain/overview#the-architecture){target=\_blank}, which processes the inputs it receives from the Phala blockchain, acting as an encrypted message queue, and guarantees secure and faithful execution, regardless of the presence of malicious workers. In this sense, the Phala blockchain requests a price feed update, which the Phala off-chain workers fetch from Ethereum MainNet, and return to the Phala blockchain.

It's important to note that Phala isn't limited to replicating existing Oracles. You can create entirely new Oracles by sourcing off-chain data via Phat Contracts. In this [Phat-EVM Oracle example](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phat-offchain-rollup/blob/main/EvmRollup.md){target=\_blank}, pricing data is sourced from the CoinGecko API. Price quote updates can then be constantly streamed from the Phat contract (push design), or the EVM smart contract can ask for a refreshed quote from the Phat contract (pull design).

## Fetch Price Data {: #fetch-price-data }

There are several price feeds available on the demo EVM network that you can interact with. The price feeds enabled by Phat Contracts use the same interface as the Chainlink price feeds. The data lives in a series of smart contracts (one per price feed) and can be fetched with the aggregator interface:

???+ code "AggregatorV3Interface.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface AggregatorV3Interface {
    /**
     * Returns the decimals to offset on the getLatestPrice call
     */
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);

    /**
     * Returns the description of the underlying price feed aggregator
     */
    function description() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * Returns the version number representing the type of aggregator the proxy points to
     */
    function version() external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * Returns price data about a specific round
     */
    function getRoundData(uint80 _roundId) external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);

    /**
     * Returns price data from the latest round
     */
    function latestRoundData() external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);
}
    ```

As seen above in the interface, there are five functions for fetching data: `decimals`, `description`, `version`, `getRoundData`, and `latestRoundData`. For more information about the `AggregatorV3Interface.sol`, see the [Chainlink API Reference](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference){target=\_blank}.

### Supported Assets {: #supported-assets }

Phala sources its price feed data by mirroring Chainlink's price feeds from Ethereum MainNet. Currently, there are data feed contracts for [the demo EVM network](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/){target=\_blank} for the following asset pairs:

### Interacting with Price Feeds on the Tanssi Demo EVM Network {: #interacting-with-price-feeds-demo-evm-network }

Next, this tutorial will showcase interacting with the price feed contracts on the demo EVM network. These contracts are already deployed on the demo EVM network, so you can interact with them by accessing the aggregator contract corresponding to your desired asset.

For a refresher on setting up Remix to interface with the demo EVM network, see the [Deploy Smart Contracts with Remix](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} guide. Secondly, make sure you have [connected MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} to the demo EVM network.

Paste the [aggregator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol){target=\_blank} into a new file in Remix and compile it.

![Compile aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/phala-1.webp)

Then, take the following steps:

1. Head to the **Deploy and Run Transactions** tab
2. Set the **ENVIRONMENT** to **Injected Provider -- MetaMask**
3. Select the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract from the **CONTRACT** dropdown
4. Enter the data feed contract address corresponding to `BTC to USD`, which is `0x89BC5048d634859aef743fF2152363c0e83a6a49` on the demo EVM network in the **At Address** field and click the **At Address** button

![Access aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/phala-2.webp)

The aggregator contract should now be accessible. To interact with the aggregator contract, take the following steps:

1. Expand the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract to reveal the available functions
2. Click **decimals** to query how many digits after the decimal point are included in the returned price data
3. Click **description** to verify the asset pair of the price feed
4. Click **latestRoundData** to see the most recent price data for the asset pair. The price data for the pair is returned as the **int256 answer**

![Check price data](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/phala-3.webp)

Note that to obtain a readable price, you must account for the decimals of the price feed, which is available with the `decimals()` method. So in this example, where the price feed returned a value of `5230364122303`, the decimal point will need to be moved eight places, which corresponds to a Bitcoin price of `$52,303.64` at the time of writing.

## Launching Price Feeds on an EVM Network {: #launching-price-feeds-on-an-evm-network }

It's easy to launch price feeds on a Tanssi-powered EVM network! The following sections will walk through the process of launching a variety of price feeds. This process can be followed for quick Trial networks and dedicated networks on [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}. Please be advised that these instructions are for demonstration purposes only, and it's highly recommended that you [contact the Phala Team](https://dashboard.phala.network){target=\_blank} for assistance in any production scenarios.

### Setup {: #setup }

To get started, clone the [Phala Mirrored Price Feed repo](https://github.com/Phala-Network/mirrored-price-feed){target=\_blank} to a local directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
cd mirrored-price-feed/ && yarn install
```

Then, you'll need to configure your `.env` file. There's a convenient sample file in the repo that you can refer to. From the command line, run:  

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Next, edit your `.env` to insert the private key of an account funded on your network, and the RPC URL of your network. If building on your own network, you can fund a dummy account from the Sudo account of your network. Your network's Sudo address and RPC URL are both accessible from your dashboard on the [Tanssi DApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. You can leave the other fields in the `.env` blank. Your `.env` should resemble the below:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
RPC_URL=INSERT_YOUR_NETWORK_RPC_URL
VERIFIER_URL=
VERIFY_ADDRESS=
```

!!! note
    You should never share your seed phrase (mnemonic) or private key with anyone. This gives them direct access to your funds. This guide is for educational purposes only.

### Configure Deployment Script {: #configure-deployment-script }

Next, you'll need to edit the `OffchainAggregator.s.sol` file located in the scripts directory. `OffchainAggregator.sol` takes two parameters upon deployment, a `decimals` value, and a description of the price feed. The decimal value can remain unchanged at `8`, and the description should be changed to the price feed that you'd like to add to your network. In this case, `BTC / USD` is specified. Take care to copy the description exactly as shown, and remember that only specified assets shown in the [Fetch Price Feed Data](#supported-assets) section are supported. If you specify an asset not supported by Phala, the price feed will not work correctly. Your `OffchainAggregator.s.sol` should resemble the following:

???+ code "OffchainAggregator.s.sol"

    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {Script, console2} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {OffchainAggregator} from "../src/OffchainAggregator.sol";

contract OffchainAggregatorScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        OffchainAggregator aggregator = new OffchainAggregator(
          8,
          'BTC / USD'
        );
        console2.log(address(aggregator));
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
    ```

There are a few more changes that you need to make in `feeder.ts`, the file that maintains and updates your price feeds. You'll need to insert the details of your EVM network as follows:

```typescript
const chain = defineChain({
  id: INSERT_EVM_CHAIN_ID,
  name: 'dancelight-evm-network',
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
    public: {
      http: ['INSERT_RPC_URL'],
    },
  },
});
```

You'll also see two arrays of contract addresses at the top of `feeder.ts`. The first array, named `mainnetFeedContracts` refers to Ethereum MainNet aggregator contract addresses, and you can leave that untouched. The second array, named `aggregatorContracts ` still contains the addresses of the aggregator contracts on the demo EVM network. You should erase this array such that it is empty. Later in this guide, you'll return to it and add the contract addresses of your aggregator contracts specific to your Tanssi EVM network once they are deployed.

Once you're finished editing, your `feeder.ts` file should resemble the below:

???+ code "feeder.ts"

    ```ts
    import {
  createPublicClient,
  http,
  parseAbi,
  createWalletClient,
  defineChain,

### Build and Test {: #build-and-test }

Run the following commands to build and test the project:

```bash
yarn build
```

```bash
yarn test
```

If everything was successful, you'll see output like the following:

### Deploy {: #deploy }

To deploy your aggregator contract for the specified asset/base pair to your EVM network, use the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

You'll get a transaction status as well as a contract address. Copy this contract address, as you'll need to refer to it in the following steps.

### Access Aggregator Contract {: #access-aggregator-contract }

Next, this tutorial will demonstrate interacting with the newly deployed aggregator contract. Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is connected to your EVM network. You can add your network to your MetaMask by pressing **Add to MetaMask** on your dashboard on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}.

Paste the [aggregator contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-evm/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/shared/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol){target=\_blank} into a new file in Remix and compile it.

Then, take the following steps:

1. Head to the **Deploy and Run Transactions** tab
2. Set the **ENVIRONMENT** to **Injected Provider -- MetaMask** and ensure that your MetaMask is on the network of your EVM network. You can verify the EVM chain ID in Remix if you are unsure
3. Select the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract from the **CONTRACT** dropdown
4. Enter the data feed contract address corresponding to your desired asset pair that was returned on the command line in the prior section in the **At Address** field and click the **At Address** button

![Access aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/phala-4.webp)

Expand the **AggregatorV3Interface** contract to reveal the available functions and click **latestRoundData** to see the most recent price data for the asset pair. You should see `0` values for all. This is because your aggregator contract has been deployed, but it hasn't yet fetched price data. You can fix this with a quick price feed update.

![Get output of deployed aggregator contract](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/oracles/phala/phala-5.webp)

### Trigger Price Feed Update {: #Trigger Price Feed Update }

In a prior section, you cleared out the array of aggregator contracts, but since you've now deployed an aggregator contract, you should specify it in the `feeder.ts` file so that you can manually trigger a refresh of the price data. Edit the `aggregatorContracts` array as follows:

```typescript
const aggregatorContracts = {
  'BTC-USD': 'INSERT_AGGREGATOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS',
}
```

Then, from the command line, run the following command:

```bash
npx tsx feeder.ts 
```

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npx tsx feeder.ts</span>
  <span data-ty>BTC-USD updated, transmit tx hash: Oxf1797cfc5bd71e2d848b099cae197ff30dafb5f6947481a5ef6c69271e059a96</span>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span> </span>
</div>

Upon returning to Remix, click **latestRoundData** once more, and after waiting a moment, you should see an accurate value returned.

# Integrate RainbowKit with a Tanssi Network 

## Introduction 

[RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank} is a React library that adds wallet connection capabilities to a dApp. It supports numerous wallets and enables features such as switching connection chains, ENS address resolution, and balance display out-of-the-box. RainbowKit offers customization options for all EVM-compatible chains, making it possible to connect wallets to a network easily.


RainbowKit bundles together multiple tools to simplify adding wallet connections to a dApp:

- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/){target=\_blank} - a React Hooks library for interacting with Ethereum accounts, wallets, contracts, transactions, signing, ENS, and more
- [viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} - TypeScript interface which provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum
- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank} - adds encrypted connections and enhanced UX experiences like connecting a mobile wallet by scanning a QR code
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview){target=\_blank} - helps manage and update server state within the application

This guide explains how to add RainbowKit to a dApp running on top of a Tanssi-powered network using the CLI, along with options for further customizing the integration.

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

To start a new project, RainbowKit can scaffold a project using the CLI, combining RainbowKit and Wagmi in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} application. Use your preferred package manager to run the CLI command and start the project:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
    ```
=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
    ```

The script will prompt for a project name, generate a new directory with the boilerplate starter code, and install all required dependencies. 

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
</span>
    <span data-ty="input" data-ty-prompt=""> 🌈 Welcome to RainbowKit!</span>

    <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span></span>
</div>

Navigate to the project directory, start the development server, and open `http://localhost:3000` to view the project locally:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    npm run dev 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    yarn dev
    ```

The starting screen should look like this:

![Scaffolded RainbowKit project landing page](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-1.webp)

Open the project in a code editor and examine the directory and file structure, paying particular attention to the `wagmi.ts` file. This file allows configuration of the chains included in the list of networks that users can connect to via the dApp.

Since the [demo EVM network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo/){target=\_blank} is a custom network on Tanssi, it cannot be imported directly from `wagmi/chains`. Instead, define the chain manually in the `wagmi.ts` file. For example, if the network uses the Tanssi demo network or another EVM-compatible chain, the necessary configurations must be added manually.

Here is the configuration for the demo EVM network on Tanssi:

=== "Demo EVM Network"
    ```js title="src/wagmi.ts"
    import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { getDefaultConfig, RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { QueryClientProvider, QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { type Chain } from 'viem'

export const demoEVMChain = {
  id: 5678,
  name: "Tanssi demo EVM Network",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "TANGO", symbol: "TANGO", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: { http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'] }
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: { name: 'Demo EVM Explorer', url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/' }
  },
} as const satisfies Chain


export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My Tanssi-powered Network',
  projectId: 'TODO: get project id from...',
  chains: [demoEVMChain], 
  ssr: true,
});
    ```

To add support for the demo EVM network on Tanssi, update `wagmi.ts` as shown above. The following section explains how to generate the `projectId` value for WalletConnect.

## Manual Setup 

The following sections will walk you through the steps to integrate RainbowKit into an existing React application, such as installing and importing the necessary dependencies, configuring chain connections, and making the RainbowKit functionality available to users in the dApp. The setup will also include steps to specify which chain the **Connect Wallet** button should connect to by default and how to customize the RainbowKit theme to fit the project. This guide is based on the Tanssi [demo EVM network](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}, but can be adapted for your own Tanssi-powered EVM network by changing the RPC URL parameter.

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- A Tanssi EVM-compatible network

- An existing dApp built with [React](https://react.dev/){target=\_blank}

- The [RainbowKit examples repository](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} includes templates for multiple React frameworks
    
 - To follow this guide, visit [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} and follow the **Automatic Installation** instructions, selecting Typescript and the App Router options during setup 

- The wallet must support custom networks, as the Tanssi demo EVM network will be added manually

- A WalletConnect `projectId` - every dApp relying on WalletConnect is required to have an associated `projectId`. It is free to create an account,  and an ID can be generated instantly

    To obtain a WalletConnect `projectId`:

    1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank}
    2. On the **Projects** page, select **Create** 
    3. Add the project information (leaving the **Homepage URL** blank if the dApp is not deployed)
    4. Select the **AppKit** SDK
    5. Select a coding environment or platform (React is used in this guide)
    6. Locate the `projectId` in the left menu. or find it in the **Get started** code snippet of WalletConnect Quickstart
 
### Getting Started {: #getting-started }

Ensure that the project is in the root directory before proceeding, then install RainbowKit and its peer dependencies:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```
These packages provide the core functionality for wallet connections (RainbowKit), Ethereum interactions (wagmi and viem), and state management (TanStack Query).

Next, start the development server to create a local dApp instance:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

After starting the server, open `http://localhost:3000` to view the Next.js application in the browser.

To test the RainbowKit connection, the MetaMask app can be used. Ensure that the Tanssi demo EVM network is connected in the MetaMask wallet.

To add the Tanssi demo EVM network to MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask and go to Settings > Networks > Add Network.
2. Input the following information:
    - Network Name: `Demo EVM Chain`
    - RPC URL: `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}`
    - Chain ID: `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_chain_id }}`
    - Currency Symbol: `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }}`
    - Block Explorer URL: `{{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_blockscout_url }}`

For detailed instructions on connecting MetaMask to the Tanssi demo EVM network, refer to the guide [Connect MetaMask to your Tanssi EVM Network](https://docs.tanssi.network/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/#connect-metamask-to-evm-network){target=\_blank}.

After connecting, `the projectId` can be safely added to the application:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project

    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

2. Add the `projectId` to this file

    ```text title=".env.local"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='INSERT_PROJECT_ID'
    ```

3. Locate the `.gitignore` file in this same directory and ensure `.env*.local` is included in the list of files to ignore. This will prevent committing the `projectId` to GitHub

The stored `projectId` will be required for configuring the `wagmi` settings in the upcoming section.

### Connect DApp to MetaMask 

With the development environment set up and MetaMask configured for the Tanssi demo EVM network, the next step is to configure the dApp to connect with MetaMask's wallet using RainbowKit. This process involves the following key steps:

1. Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query
2. Setup configuration for Wagmi
3. Wrap the application with providers
4. Add the connect button

### Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query

To proceed, ensure the project is in the root directory, and then create a new file called `wagmi.ts`. This file will contain the necessary imports and configurations to connect the dApp to wallets and interact with blockchains.

```bash
touch wagmi.ts
```
In `wagmi.ts`, import the necessary libraries and define Demo EVM Chain as the supported chain:

```ts title="wagmi.ts"
import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { getDefaultConfig, RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { QueryClientProvider, QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

import { type Chain } from 'viem'

export const demoEVMChain = {
  id: 5678,
  name: "Tanssi demo EVM Network",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "TANGO", symbol: "TANGO", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: { http: ['https://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001'] }
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: { name: 'Demo EVM Explorer', url: 'https://dancelight-2001-blockscout.tanssi-chains.network/' }
  },
} as const satisfies Chain


export const config = getDefaultConfig({
  appName: 'My Tanssi-powered Network',
  projectId: 'process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID',
  chains: [demoEVMChain ], 
  ssr: true,
});
```

### Wrap the Application with Providers

Next, create a file named `providers.tsx` to wrap the application with the necessary providers: `WagmiProvider`, and `QueryClientProvider`.

```bash
cd app &&
touch providers.tsx
```

Open `providers.tsx` add the following code to manage the providers

```ts title="providers.tsx"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { RainbowKitProvider } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { config } from '../wagmi';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider>{children}</RainbowKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

Now locate the `layout.tsx` file inside the `app` directory and modify the code to import `Providers` and wrap the application:

```ts title="layout.tsx"
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
import './globals.css';
import '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css';
import { Providers } from './providers';

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Tanssi dApp',
  description: 'Generated by create next app',
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
This ensures that the app is wrapped with all necessary providers, including wagmi, and TanStack Query for state management.

### Add the Connect Button

RainbowKit offers a `ConnectButton` component, which renders the **Connect** and **Disconnect** buttons and UI elements for switching chains. This example imports the `ConnectButton` into the existing `page.tsx` file for simplicity, though it can also be added to an element like a **Header** or **Navbar** to appear at the top of every page. Update the code in `page.tsx` as follows:

```ts title="page.tsx"
import { ConnectButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <ConnectButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Once the development server is running, the home page will display a **Connect Wallet** button. Clicking this button will open the RainbowKit modal, providing options to either connect an existing wallet or get a new one. Select **MetaMask** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection process.

The current configuration defaults to connecting to Demo EVM Chain and displays the current network, the native token balance, and the connected wallet address. If multiple networks are supported, selecting the arrow next to it will open the Switch Networks modal. This allows users to select another network and authorize the change.

Once connected, users will see their {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token balance and wallet address.

## Customize RainbowKit

RainbowKit simplifies the complexities of managing wallet connections while offering various options for customizing UI and functionality to fit the needs of a dApp. A full list of customization options can be found in the RainbowKit [documentation](https://rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank}. This section covers customizing the **Connect Wallet** button to connect initially to the Demo EVM Chain and render it in a custom color. 

### Set Custom Initial Chain

By default, RainbowKit connects to the first chain supplied to Wagmi in the config. The order of chains listed in `wagmi.ts` will match the order displayed in the **Switch Networks** modal. To ensure that the Tanssi demo EVM network is always the default connection, simply move it to the top of the chain list. However, Relying solely on this default behavior might not be the best option.

A better approach is to use the `initialChain` prop in the `RainbowKitProvider` component. This prop defines which chain the wallet will connect to initially when **Connect Wallet** is selected. To configure this, open the `providers.tsx` file and update the code by passing the `initialChain` prop with the custom Tanssi demo EVM network object defined earlier:

```Ts title="providers.tsx"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { RainbowKitProvider, darkTheme } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { config, demoEVMChain } from '../wagmi';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider initialChain={demoEVMChain}>
          {children}
        </RainbowKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );

}
```

By setting `initialChain={demoEVMChain}`, RainbowKit will attempt to connect to the Tanssi demo EVM network first whenever the **Connect Wallet** button is clicked.

### Define Custom Theme Colors

RainbowKit provides three built-in theme functions: `lightTheme`, `darkTheme`, and `midnightTheme`. These functions return a theme object that can be passed to the `RainbowKitProvider` prop `theme` to customize colors, border radius, font stack, and overlay blur. Update `providers.tsx` with the following code and ensure that `darkTheme` is added to the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` import statement for the changes to apply correctly. After customizing the initial chain and theme, the `providers.tsx` file will look like this:

```js title="providers.tsx"
'use client';

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi';
import { RainbowKitProvider, darkTheme } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { config, demoEVMChain } from '../wagmi';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <RainbowKitProvider
          initialChain={demoEVMChain}
          theme={darkTheme({
            accentColor: '#189B9B', // Tanssi accent color
            accentColorForeground: 'white',
            borderRadius: 'medium',
            fontStack: 'system',
            overlayBlur: 'small'
          })}
        >
          {children}
        </RainbowKitProvider>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```
This configuration sets a dark theme with custom properties:

- `accentColor` - the primary highlight color. In this example, Tanssi's accent color (#189B9B) is used, but it can be adjusted to match the branding of the dApp
- `accentColorForeground` - the text color used on top of the accent color
- `borderRadius` - controls the roundness of UI elements. Options are 'none', 'small', 'medium', or 'large'
- `fontStack` - defines the fonts used. 'system' uses the default system fonts
- `overlayBlur` - the blur effect applied to the background when modals are open

!!! tip
    Experiment with different theme functions (`lightTheme`, `darkTheme`, `midnightTheme`) and color combinations to find the best match for the visual style of the dApp.

## Handle Disconnections

To disconnect MetaMask from the dApp and reconnect for testing purposes, two methods can be used to complete this process.  

### Disconnect from DApp {: #disconnect-from-dapp }

RainbowKit includes a **Disconnect** button out of the box. To open the modal, select the arrow next to the account number. Click the **Disconnect** button. At this point, the **Connect Wallet** option will reappear, and the account information will no longer be visible.

![Built in Disconnect button](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-2.webp)

### Disconnect from MetaMask  {: #disconnect-from-metamask }

Some users prefer to disconnect from their wallet rather than use a button within a dApp. To use this method: 

1. Select the MetaMask extension in the browser to open the modal
2. Select the three dots in the upper right corner of the MetaMask modal
3. Select **Connected sites**
4. Review the list of sites connected to the wallet
5. Select **Disconnect** for each site that should be disconnected

## Final Result {: #final-result }

The **Connect Wallet** button on the home page should now render in the color specified for `accentColor` during theme customization. After selecting **Connect Wallet**, the same accent color will be displayed in the modal. MetaMask can be chosen, and signing the transaction will authorize the connection. The Tanssi demo EVM network will appear as the connected network, along with the {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_token_symbol }} token balance, without the need for manual network switching.

# How to Use Chopsticks to Fork Your Network

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks){target=\_blank} provides a developer-friendly method of locally forking existing [Substrate-based](/learn/framework/overview/){target=\_blank} chains. It allows for the replaying of blocks to easily examine how transactions affect the state, the forking of multiple Tanssi networks for XCM testing, and more. This empowers developers to test and experiment with their custom blockchain configurations in a local development environment without deploying a live network.

Overall, Chopsticks aims to simplify the process of building blockchain applications on Substrate and make it accessible to a wider range of developers.

This article will cover using Chopsticks to fork and interact with the local copy of a Tanssi network.

!!! note
    Chopsticks currently does not support calls done via the Ethereum JSON-RPC. Consequently, you can't fork your chain using Chopsticks and connect Metamask to it.

## Prerequisites {: #prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to clone the repository along with its submodules([Smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot.git){target=\_blank}):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks.git
```

Then, get into the folder and install the dependencies using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install){target=\_blank}:

```bash
 cd chopsticks && yarn
```

Finally, build the project:

```bash
yarn build-wasm
```

Now the development environment is ready to start testing and debugging Tanssi-deployed networks.

## Forking a Demo EVM Network with Chopsticks {: #forking-demo-chain }

To fork a Tanssi network using Chopsticks, execute the command with only the RPC endpoint as a parameter:

```bash
yarn start --endpoint {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }}
```

This command will start a local clone of the chain as it was in the latest block.

<div id="termynal" data-termynal>
  <span data-ty="input"><span class="file-path"></span>
    chopsticks % yarn start --endpoint wss://services.tanssi-testnet.network/dancelight-2001
  </span>
  <span data-ty>
    [01:59:42.628] INFO (xcm/59650): Frontier Container 2001 RPC listening on port 8000
  </span>
</div>

Typically, the configuration parameters are stored in a configuration file, as are the configurations in the repository's `configs` folder for the relay chains and parachains deployed in the Dotsama ecosystem. The following configuration file works for the [demo EVM network](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/demo-evm-network/){target=\_blank}, overriding the chain's sudo account with Alith's and additionally funding the account with tokens:

```yaml
endpoint: {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }}
mock-signature-host: true
allow-unresolved-imports: true
db: ./tmp/db_ftrcon.sqlite

import-storage:
  System:
    Account:
      - - - "0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac" # Alith
        - providers: 1
          sufficients: 1
          consumers: 1
          data:
            free: "100000000000000000000000"
  Sudo:
    Key: "0xf24FF3a9CF04c71Dbc94D0b566f7A27B94566cac"
```

The configuration file accepts all of the following parameters:

|           Option           |                                                 Description                                                  |
|:--------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|         `genesis`          |          The link to a parachain's raw genesis file to build the fork from, instead of an endpoint.          |
|        `timestamp`         |                                     Timestamp of the block to fork from.                                     |
|         `endpoint`         |                                    The endpoint of the parachain to fork.                                    |
|          `block`           |                       Use to specify at which block hash or number to replay the fork.                       |
|      `wasm-override`       |              Path of the Wasm to use as the parachain runtime instead of an endpoint's runtime.              |
|            `db`            |               Path to the name of the file that stores or will store the parachain's database.               |
|          `config`          |                                       Path or URL of the config file.                                        |
|           `port`           |                                      The port to expose an endpoint on.                                      |
|     `build-block-mode`     |                       How blocks should be built in the fork: batch, manual, instant.                        |
|      `import-storage`      |              A pre-defined JSON/YAML storage file path to override in the parachain's storage.               |
| `allow-unresolved-imports` |              Whether to allow Wasm unresolved imports when using a Wasm to build the parachain.              |
|           `html`           |                           Include to generate storage diff preview between blocks.                           |
|   `mock-signature-host`    | Mock signature host so that any signature starts with `0xdeadbeef` and filled by `0xcd` is considered valid. |

You can run the command `yarn start` to fork chains by specifying a local configuration file. Alternatively, the name or the GitHub URL can be used if the chain is listed in the repository's `configs` folder.

=== "Local File Path"

    ```bash
    yarn start --config=configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

=== "Chain Name"

    ```bash
    yarn start --config=polkadot
    ```

=== "GitHub URL"

    ```bash
    yarn start \
    --config=https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks.git/master/configs/polkadot.yml
    ```

All settings (except `genesis` and `timestamp`) can also be passed as flags to configure the environment completely in the command line. For example, the following command forks the demo EVM network at block 100.

```bash
yarn start --endpoint {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }} --block 100
```

### Interacting with a Fork {: #interacting-with-a-fork }

When running a fork, by default, it will be accessible at:

```text
ws://localhost:8000
```

You can interact with the parachain via libraries such as [Polkadot.js](https://github.com/polkadot-js/common){target=\_blank} and its [user interface, Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8000#/explorer){target=\_blank}.

![Polkadot Js](/images/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/dev-env/chopsticks/chopsticks-1.webp)

You should now be able to interact with the forked chain as you would with the real one.

!!! note
    If your browser cannot connect to the WebSocket endpoint provided by Chopsticks, you might need to allow insecure connections for the Polkadot.js Apps URL. Another solution is to run the [Docker version of Polkadot.js Apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps#docker){target=\_blank}.

## Replaying Blocks {: #replaying-blocks }

If you would like to replay a block and retrieve its information to dissect the effects of an extrinsic, you can use the `yarn start run-block` command. Its following flags are:

|            Flag            |                                      Description                                       |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|         `endpoint`         |                         The endpoint of the parachain to fork.                         |
|          `block`           |            Use to specify at which block hash or number to replay the fork.            |
|      `wasm-override`       |   Path of the Wasm to use as the parachain runtime instead of an endpoint's runtime.   |
|            `db`            |    Path to the name of the file that stores or will store the parachain's database.    |
|          `config`          |                            Path or URL of the config file.                             |
| `output-path=/[file_path]` |   Use to print out results to a JSON file instead of printing it out in the console.   |
|           `html`           | Include to generate an HTML representation of the storage diff preview between blocks. |
|           `open`           |                        Whether to open the HTML representation.                        |

For example, running the following command will re-run the demo EVM networks's block 1000 and write the storage diff and other data in a `chain-output.json` file:  

```bash
yarn start run-block  \
--endpoint {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_wss_url }}  \
--output-path=./chain-output.json  \
--block 1000
```

## WebSocket Commands {: #websocket-commands }

Chopstick's internal WebSocket server has special endpoints that allow the manipulation of the local Substrate chain.

These are the methods that can be invoked and their parameters:

???+ function "**dev_newBlock** (options) — Generates one or more new blocks"

    === "Parameters"

        - **options** - `{ "to": number, "count": number }` - a JSON object where `"to"` will create blocks up to a certain value, and `"count"` will increase by a certain number of blocks. Use only one entry at a time within the JSON object

    === "Example"

        ```js
        import { WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api'
        const ws = new WsProvider(`ws://localhost:8000`)
        // Creates five new blocks
        await ws.send('dev_newBlock', [{ count: 5 }])
        ```

??? function "**dev_setStorage** (values, blockHash) — Creates or overwrites the value of any storage"

    === "Parameters"

         - **values** - Object - a JSON object resembling the path to a storage value, similar to what you would retrieve via Polkadot.js  
        - **blockHash** - String - optional, the block hash at which the storage value is changed  
        
    === "Example"

        ```js
        import { WsProvider } from '@polkadot/api';
        const ws = new WsProvider(`ws://localhost:8000`);
        // Overwrites the sudo key
        await ws.send('dev_setStorage', 
            [{"Sudo": { "Key": "0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b" }}]
        );
        ```

??? function "**dev_timeTravel** (date) — Sets the timestamp of the block to the date value"

    === "Parameters"

         - **date** - Date - a string compatible with the JavaScript Date library that will change the timestamp at which the next blocks being created will be. All future blocks will be sequentially created after that point in time

# Network Templates Included in Tanssi {: #network-templates-included-in-tanssi }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Building a new network from scratch can be a daunting prospect. Fortunately, thanks to the [network development framework](/learn/framework/overview/){target=\_blank} used by Tanssi and its modular-oriented architecture, developers can leverage some pre-bundled network templates that help them jumpstart the process and benefit in some aspects, such as:

- **Head Start** - Tanssi network templates provide a starting point for your project, saving significant time and effort by providing a basic structure and a set of tested and ready-to-use functionalities. It allows developers to accelerate the construction of prototypes or minimum viable products (MVPs) and reduce the time to market

- **Consistency** - included Tanssi network templates follow established design patterns, coding standards, and best practices widely accepted among the developer community. They also provide a default set of architecture definitions to streamline blockchain development

- **UX** - Tanssi network templates cover the most demanded use cases, such as the EVM support for an Ethereum-compatible network

- **Customizability** - Tanssi network templates are a great starting point and are completely customizable. The functionalities and default configurations they include can be modified, replaced, or extended to meet the specific requirements of the use case

- **Upgrades and Compatibility** - Tanssi is built on top of an evolving framework, with new features, enhancements, and bug fixes being regularly introduced. The provided Tanssi network templates are kept up-to-date with these upgrades

## Start Building a Network {: #start-building }

To start building a decentralized network to deploy in Tanssi, some useful Tanssi network templates to kick-start the development process are provided in the [official repository](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi){target=\_blank}.

The process is as simple as:

1. Select one of the templates
2. Add the specific logic to adapt the runtime to the requirements of the use case
3. Deploy in Tanssi

![Using Templates to Speed Up the Development Process](/images/learn/decentralized-networks/templates/templates-1.webp)

The two included templates are the *baseline network template* and the *baseline EVM template*, which are presented in the following sections.

### Baseline Network Template {: #baseline-network-template }

As presented in the [Overview](/learn/tanssi/overview/){target=\_blank} article, networks deployed through Tanssi are fully sovereign and customizable blockchains.

As part of the Tanssi ecosystem, networks must include the essential components to implement the consensus mechanism and be able to interact and synchronize with the security provider of their choice (for example, [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} on Ethereum). The baseline Tanssi network template includes all the necessary functionality for the sequencers logic, p2p, database, and synchronization layers between the network and the security provider, allowing developers to focus solely on customizing their product.

This template also includes Tanssi's [Author Noting](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/pallets/author-noting/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank} module, which implements the logic for retrieving and validating the set of sequencers assigned to provide block production services to the network. It also includes logic that allows a sequencer to sign the block when the consensus mechanism determines that it is the sequencer's turn to produce the block (and thus be rewarded accordingly).

The source code for this template is public and accessible on the [Tanssi GitHub repository](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/chains/container-chains/runtime-templates/simple/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}.

### Baseline EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) Template {: #baseline-evm-template }

Extending the [baseline Tanssi network template](#baseline-network-template), this template provides not only Tanssi protocol support but also an EVM and full Ethereum compatibility.

Leveraging a set [EVM-specific modules](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank}, this template includes an Ethereum compatibility layer for networks to allow running unmodified Ethereum dApps.

Using this template, networks support the deployment and running of any existing smart contract written in Solidity or Vyper with no changes. By emulating Ethereum block production and exposing the expected RPC interface, developers can also continue using the same tools like [Metamask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org){target=\_blank}, [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}, [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry){target=\_blank}, and many more out of the box, with no extra adapters.

With this EVM template, developers can deploy a [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}-like network in no time and add their custom logic and features specific to their use case.

The source code for this template is public and accessible on the [Tanssi GitHub repository](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/chains/container-chains/runtime-templates/frontier/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}.

# Tanssi Networks Overview {: #networks-tanssi-overview }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Networks deployed through Tanssi receive many [benefits](/learn/tanssi/overview/#what-tanssi-provides){target=\_blank}, like block production as a service, data retrievability as a service, and security through an [external security providers](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank} such as [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} on Ethereum.

Also, because Tanssi-powered networks are based on a [modular tech stack](/learn/framework/){target=\_blank}, they profit from unique advantages when customizations are required at a runtime level. This [modularity](/learn/framework/modules/){target=\_blank} allows developers to add functionality directly into the runtime or extend the capabilities of the EVM itself via precompiled contracts.

For example, Tanssi provides a ready-to-use [template](/learn/decentralized-networks/included-templates#baseline-evm-template){target=\_blank} that includes [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} modules, enabling the effortless deployment of an EVM-compatible networks, similar to [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network){target=\_blank}.

This section covers the fundamentals of a Tanssi network, its architecture, its core modules and functionalities, and the transaction fee mechanism.

## General Architecture {: #general-architecture}

As previously discussed, networks deployed through Tanssi are customizable blockchains that, among other features, receive block production as a service and inherit security with deterministic block finality within seconds from an external security provider. 

Tanssi-powered networks are fully decentralized networks. The decentralized nature of the networks considerably increases their resilience and fault tolerance since they don't rely on a single authority or entity to ensure their liveness, security, and performance but on trustless, decentralized protocols. For example, they receive block production services from a decentralized and incentivized set of sequencers managed by Tanssi.

The Tanssi protocol runs with an [external security provider](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank}, which has a set of operators (also called validators) with assets at stake, validating the transactions from the Tanssi network itself and all of the networks deployed through Tanssi. This way, all Tanssi-powered networks inherit the economic security derived from the Tanssi protocol and, indirectly, from the operators, which verify every transaction from every network. Tanssi networks don't need to run their own operator set nor bootstrap liquidity to secure their protocol.

Tanssi networks also benefit from a set of Data-Preservers, with full archive nodes, ensuring the data availability layer availability. These data-preservers are incentivized through Tanssi's data retrieval services and also provide the RPC infrastructure for apps and users interacting with Tanssi networks.

## Network Transaction Flow {: #network-transaction-flow }

A transaction submitted to a Tanssi-powered network follows a complex yet seamless path from submission to block inclusion and finalization. The network infrastructure, Tanssi, and the chosen [security provider](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank} work together at different levels to ensure the process happens as quickly as possible, usually taking around 30 seconds. Remember that a transaction in a Tanssi network reaches deterministic finality. Consequently, once the transaction is final, it becomes irreversible and unchangeable, and the state transition resulting from executing that transaction is final.

For example, a user initiates a transaction when interacting via an application deployed to a Tanssi-powered network. The RPC provider will share the transaction, which sits in the chain's transaction pool, with all network participants. A sequencer assigned by Tanssi to that network will eventually pick up the transaction and include it in the next network block.

Then, the sequencer will share with the security provider's operators:

- The block itself with the state transitions
- The storage components in the Tanssi network database that the block is modifying
- The necessary hashes of the unaffected points in the Merkle tree of the storage

These components constitute the proof of validity (PoV).

Next, the PoV is verified by the security provider's operators. Note that the operators do not check that the Tanssi network storage is valid but that the state transitions that affect it are. A summary of that verification is then gossiped to other operators so they can verify it and include it in the next Tanssi block. Lastly, that Tanssi block with all the networks' verifications is finalized.

The transaction flow process is summarized in the following diagram:

# Core Runtime Features {: #core-runtime-features }

## Introduction {: #introduction}

Networks deployed through Tanssi have [many benefits](/learn/tanssi/overview/#what-tanssi-provides){target=\_blank} due to its unique [architecture](/learn/tanssi/overview/#tanssi-architecture){target=\_blank}.

Nevertheless, Tanssi-powered networks are also unique due to the [framework](/learn/framework/){target=\_blank} (Substrate) they are built on top of, which provides some unique characteristics that developers can leverage to fine-tune specific behaviors in their runtime.

This section covers some of these Tanssi network core runtime-specific features, including the different origins a transaction might have, the different types of transactions and how they are executed and included in a block, the special account known as _SUDO_, and the quite unique feature of Tanssi networks: the forkless runtime upgrades.

## Origins {: #origins}

Generally speaking, all calls in a Tanssi network have an origin. But what is an origin? Developers from the EVM realm might be familiar with the concept of _msg.sender_ in EVM transactions. Origins are to Tanssi networks what _msg.sender_ is to an EVM transaction, but supercharged with many extra functionalities.

An origin defines where the call is coming from. In contrast to Ethereum-compatible chains, there can be many origins in Tanssi networks. For example, the _msg.sender_ of an EVM transaction is known as a _signed origin_, which means that the call is a transaction that was signed by some on-chain account's private key. This allows the runtime to authenticate the source of the call and, for example, charge transaction fees to the associated account.

However, origins can do much more than represent a private key/public key pair. Origins also have different privilege levels. For example, a _signed origin_ can send a transaction that is dispatched by the private key/public key pair but should not be able to authorize a runtime upgrade.

Some of the most common types of origins are:

- **Root** - a system-level origin with the highest privilege level. It can be thought of as a superuser of the chain, which can execute any call
- **Signed** - as mentioned before, the origin of a transaction signed by an on-chain account's private key, which includes the account identifier (address) as the signer
- **None** - a lack of origin. Used in specific actions that must be agreed upon at a runtime level. For example, you can program your runtime so that a transaction with _none_  origin can enact a pre-authorized runtime upgrade, which means that the transaction has no fee associated with it
- **Custom** - developers can also create custom origins for specific use cases. For example, [Moonbeam's on-chain governance](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/features/governance){target=\_blank} has specific origins for each type of governance vote, called _tracks_. Consequently, each track can be configured to only execute calls with specific privilege levels. One track is _Root_, whose origin is the _Root_ origin mentioned before, and has a very restrictive configuration for votes to go through. But other tracks have much lower privilege levels to do some less critical network operations

## Transaction Types {: #transaction-types}

Tanssi networks have three main types of transactions:

- **Signed Transactions** - include a signed payload requesting to execute some runtime call. Generally, the signature is associated with a private key/public key pair. Depending on the runtime logic, the account associated with the signature pays a transaction fee
- **Unsigned Transactions** - include an unsigned payload requesting to execute some runtime call. Because these transactions are unsigned, there is no account associated with them. Consequently, runtimes need to define specific conditions that prevent network spam or replay attacks because there is no fee mechanism to prevent such malicious behaviors. One example of an unsigned transaction is executing pre-approved actions, like a runtime upgrade
- **Inherent Transactions** - an unsigned transaction that a sequencer inserts into a block when initializing its construction. These transactions are part of the block and are not stored in the transaction pool or shared among network participants. In addition, the data inserted through inherent transactions can skip runtime validation, and it might be up to operators to accept it. One example is the block timestamp. This is injected into the block by an inherent transaction, and operators can accept or reject the block based on whether the timestamp is within some acceptable range

## Transaction Execution {: #transaction-execution}

When a user or application submits a signed transaction to a Tanssi network, the transaction is validated at a full-node level using rules defined in the runtime, and then it is queued in a transaction pool. This ensures that only transactions that comply with certain chain-specific conditions are considered to be included in a block.

!!! note
    The most common type of transaction is a signed transaction. Nevertheless, unsigned transactions are also validated before they are queued in the transaction pool.

The valid transaction queue comprises two pools: ready and future. The ready queue contains all transactions that can be included in a new pending block. The future queue is for transactions that don't meet all the criteria to be included now but might become valid. For example, transactions with a future nonce. Invalid transactions are directly rejected.

During the block-building process, a sequencer uses a [priority system](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/fb24fda76d613305ebb2e5728c75362c94b64aa1/frame/transaction-payment/src/lib.rs#L614-L681){target=\_blank} through a transaction orchestration module to order transactions for the next block, until the block reaches its maximum capacity. The block building and execution order has the following operations:

- **Initializing a Block** - known as `on_initialize`,  enables you to define runtime logic executed before any other transaction is accounted for. For example, inherent transactions, like the timestamp in the previous example, are commonly executed when initializing a block. Once the initialization logic is completed, the transaction orchestration module verifies the parent hash in the block header and the trie root to ensure the information is correct
- **Transaction Execution** - with the block already initialized, the transaction orchestration module executes each valid transaction according to its priority. The initial state is not cached before the execution, meaning that if one of the transactions fails mid-execution, any state changes committed up to that moment cannot be reverted, and the subsequent block will be invalid. Consequently, runtime logic should perform all necessary checks to ensure all valid transactions will succeed
- **Finalizing a Block** - after all queued valid transactions are executed or the block limit is reached, the orchestration module calls into each runtime module the `on_idle` and `on_finalize` functions. These two functions allow the definition of extra business logic that is automatically executed in the block finalization process. After the last `on_finalize` function is called, the orchestration module ensures that the block digest and storage root match what was calculated when the block was initialized

## Forkless Upgrades {: #forkless-upgrades}

Networks deployed through Tanssi have a thrilling feature: [forkless upgrades](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/maintenance/runtime-upgrades/){target=\_blank}. Forkless upgrades allow developers to change the state transition function that governs the chain without creating a network fork, as seen on Ethereum multiple times. Furthermore, if the Tanssi network is set up with an on-chain governance system, upgrades to the network can happen in a truly decentralized and trustless way.

Forkless upgrades are made possible by storing the state transition function as a WebAssembly (Wasm) blob in both the Tanssi network itself and the Tanssi-powered network. When a new runtime is scheduled through a function call in the Tanssi-powered network, the Tanssi network validates this block, so it is notified and readies itself to validate incoming blocks using the most recent state transition function. Following a specified runtime upgrade delay period, a Tanssi sequencer on the Tanssi-powered network constructs a block that references a Tanssi network block, signaling to the Tanssi network that it can now apply the new runtime. Consequently, this new state transition function is utilized for that specific block. As all infrastructure participants at the network level employ the on-chain Wasm blob, every Tanssi network node operator can validate new blocks using the latest state transition function.

A high-level summary of the runtime upgrade process is shown in the following diagram:

![Runtime Upgrade Process Tanssi Networks](/images/learn/decentralized-networks/runtime-features/runtime-features-1.webp)

## SUDO Account {: #sudo-account}

Tanssi networks may use a specific module called [SUDO](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_sudo/pallet/struct.Pallet.html){target=\_blank}. This module introduces a new type of account, also named _SUDO_, that can execute transactions with the [_Root_ origin](#origins).

Consequently, the SUDO account can perform **any** action that the runtime allows the _Root_ origin to execute. This can include:

- Mint new native Tanssi network tokens
- Perform [forkless runtime upgrades](#forkless-upgrades)
- Send transactions impersonating other [origin types](#origins). Therefore, SUDO can send transactions on behalf of other users without accessing their private key

_SUDO_ is recommended for TestNets as it allows them to swiftly make changes without the need to go through a lengthy on-chain governance process. It is good practice to have _SUDO_ keys stored safely and grant access to _SUDO_ calls via proxy accounts. Nevertheless, having _SUDO_ enabled in a production environment can lead to undesired consequences.

**Understanding the centralization risks of having _SUDO_ in a production environment is key.**

# Transaction Fees {: #transaction-fees }

## Introduction {: #introduction}

Tanssi-powered networks are built with a [modular framework](/learn/framework/){target=\_blank} called [Substrate](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}. With this framework, you can build unique ways to handle transaction fees. For example, most transactions use a specific module called [Transaction Payment](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment){target=\_blank}. However, transaction fees on Tanssi-powered EVM-compatible networks can be charged at an EVM execution level, bypassing other fee-related modules.

Under the hood, for execution time, instead of working with a gas-based mechanism, all Tanssi networks work with a [weight-based mechanism](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/parachain-basics/blocks-transactions-fees/fees/){target=\_blank}. Weight refers to the time (in picoseconds) it takes to validate a block. Generally speaking, for both EVM and non-EVM Tanssi networks, all function calls have a weight associated with them, which sets limits on storage input/output and computation. For Tanssi EVM networks, there is a gas-to-weight mapping that fully complies with the expected gas requirements for Ethereum API-based tools.

A transaction fee scheme is applied on top of the weight-based mechanism to ensure economic incentives are in line to limit the execution time, computation, and number of calls (database read/writes) to perform operations. Transaction fees are fundamental to preventing network spam, as they represent the cost of using the Tanssi network service. Consequently, a user interacting with the network through a specific function call will pay a transaction fee determined by a baseline fee algorithm.

This page covers the fundamentals of transaction fees for Tanssi networks. It first covers the underlying transaction fee architecture and how it is adapted to a fully EIP-1559-compliant model for Tanssi EVM networks.

## Baseline Fees Calculation {: #baseline-fees }

Every action that alters the state of a Tanssi network incurs a transaction fee. This fee is essential for the network's operation, covering the computational resources required to process transactions, similar to the gas and gas price parameters in EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum.

Tanssi networks [modular framework](/learn/framework/){target=\_blank} use a weight-based fee calculation mechanism to determine transaction fees. This approach considers various factors, including computational resources and storage operations (inputs/outputs), to reflect the true cost of transactions accurately. By accounting for these elements, the network ensures fair and efficient resource allocation.

Furthermore, Tanssi networks modularity ensures that EVM-compatible networks support legacy and [EIP-1559 compatible](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} transaction pricing mechanisms, ensuring full compatibility with development environments commonly used in Ethereum.

This section outlines all the different concepts associated with transaction fees for Tanssi networks.

### Weight {: #baseline-weight}

Broadly speaking, weight refers to the execution time it takes to validate a block, measured in picoseconds. Weight is divided into two separate variables:

- **`refTime`** - corresponds to the weight associated with computation time and database reads/writes
- **`proofSize`** - corresponds to the weight associated with the size of the Proof-Of-Validity (or PoV for short). The PoV is associated with the relevant state of a transaction, and it is what the Tanssi network sequencer shares with the security provider operators to get a block validated and finalized as part of the [network transaction flow](/learn/decentralized-networks/overview/#network-transaction-flow){target=\_blank}

To find the weights for all function calls, they are benchmarked in a system with reference hardware, and the approximate values of `refTime` and `proofSize` are set. This process is repeated for all function calls that consume blockspace and affect the PoV.

For transactions in which the fees are handled by the [transaction payment](https://docs.rs/pallet-transaction-payment/latest/pallet_transaction_payment){target=\_blank} module, all weight-based parameters are then passed through a _weight to fee_ algorithm that converts all to a final value, deducted from the sender's account when executing the function call. The algorithm can be customized, but Tanssi networks have a constant value set.

For EVM transactions, gas is converted to weight through a gas-to-weight algorithm so that all EVM calls can be mapped to block execution time. Nevertheless, fees are handled at an EVM execution level.

### Baseline Transaction Fees {: #baseline-transaction-fees}

<!-- https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/transaction-payment/src/lib.rs#L627-L652 -->

With all function calls benchmarked, the transaction fee for each specific call can be obtained. Transaction fees are typically comprised of the following elements:

- **`BaseFee`** - baseline cost for a transaction to be included. It accounts for the transaction inclusion overhead, like signature verification. The fee is defined by two separate parameters:
    - **`ExtrinsicBaseWeight`** - a constant value that represents the weight of the transaction inclusion overhead
    - **`WeightToFee`** - a polynomial function that converts weight to fee
- **`WeightFee`** - fee defined by two separate parameters:
    - **`BenchmarkedWeight`** - weight that accounts for the complexity (execution time) of a specific call
    - **`CongestionMultiplier`** - a function that converts weight to fee and can be adjusted to account for the congestion of the network (weight consumed in the previous block). The default strategy for Tanssi networks is [`SlowAdjustingFeeUpdate`](https://research.web3.foundation/Polkadot/overview/token-economics#2-slow-adjusting-mechanism){target=\_blank}, which adjusts this multiplier slowly over time following the network load
- **`LengthFee`** - a fee correlated to the length in bytes of the function call. The fee is defined by two separate parameters:
    - **`ByteLengthFunctionCall`** - length in bytes of the call being executed
    - **`LengthToFee`** - a function that defines the per-byte fee algorithm. For Tanssi networks, this is a constant value
- **`Tip`** - an optional value that increases the overall fee, increasing the priority of the transaction by incentivizing sequencers to include it in the next block

Therefore, in general terms, the transaction fee can be calculated with the following equation:

<!-- https://github.com/moondance-labs/substrate/blob/master/frame/support/src/weights/extrinsic_weights.rs#L57 -->
<!-- https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/container-chains/templates/frontier/runtime/src/lib.rs#L265-L277 -->

```text
BaseFee = ExtrinsicBaseWeight * WeightToFee
WeightFee = BenchmarkedWeight  * CongestionMultiplier
LengthFee = ByteLengthFunctionCall * LengthToFee

InclusionFee = BaseFee + WeightFee + LengthFee
FinalFee = InclusionFee + Tip
```

All non-EVM function calls available to developers use these baseline calculations for transaction fees. Tanssi EVM networks have an extra layer to translate this fee scheme into an Ethereum-like scheme from an Ethereum JSON-RPC and EVM perspective. 

### EVM Transaction Fees {: #evm-transaction-fees }

<!-- https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/blob/272fe8839f87161ed89350de166b379f1f4c6136/frame/base-fee/src/lib.rs#L126-L199 -->

Tanssi offers [templates for full Tanssi EVM-compatible networks](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank}. Such networks provide an Ethereum-like environment for developers, where they can use Eth-specific libraries like [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/hardhat/){target=_blank}, and [Foundry](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/foundry/){target=\_blank}.

In addition, all Tanssi EVM-compatible networks have an [EIP-1559 compatible](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} transaction pricing mechanism for EVM transactions. But they support both commonly used EVM transaction types:

- **Type 0 (Legacy)** - the transaction fee is calculated through a single gas price value that is included in the signed transaction blob. Because Tanssi EVM-compatible networks have a dynamic pricing mechanism, gas price must be greater than the current block's `baseFee` for a transaction to be considered valid
- **Type 2 (EIP-1559)** - the transaction fee is calculated with a combination of the `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` from the signed transaction blob, and the network's `baseFee` dynamically changes based on block congestion

Independently of the transaction type, the outcome of all EVM transactions is that there is an associated cost in native tokens that the network must charge. 

By default, Tanssi EVM-compatible networks are configured with the following parameters:

- **Minimum BaseFee** - the minimum gas price of the network in case there are no transactions for long periods. The default value is set to 1 GWei
- **Block Fulness Target (Elasticity)** - the target gas used in a block so that the `baseFee` remains the same. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} defines this value as a constant set to 2, meaning that the target usage is 50% of the block gas limit. All Tanssi EVM-compatible networks are set with the same target
- **Maximum BaseFee Increase** - the maximum amount the `baseFee` can increase or decrease, in percent points, based on the previous block target usage. [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559){target=\_blank} defines this value as a constant set to 12.5%. Consequently, if the block is full/empty, the `baseFee` will increase/decrease by 12.5%, and any intermediate values are linearly adjusted. Developers can configure this value for Tanssi EVM-compatible networks, but the default value is 12.5%

!!! note
    One key difference in Tanssi EVM-compatible networks EIP-1559 implementation is that the transaction fees are calculated using the previous block `baseFee`.

The EVM transaction fee cost associated with all Tanssi EVM-compatible networks is captured at an EVM execution level. Nevertheless, EVM transactions do take block execution time. Therefore a gas-to-weight algorithm is required to account for the weight consumed by a specific call relative to the gas it is consuming.

<!-- https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/container-chains/templates/frontier/runtime/src/lib.rs#L825 -->
<!-- https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier/blob/272fe8839f87161ed89350de166b379f1f4c6136/primitives/evm/src/lib.rs#L253-L265 -->

Ultimately, the transaction fee and weight associated to an EVM call in a Tanssi EVM-compatible network can be calculated with the following formula:

=== "EIP-1559"
    ```text
    Gas Price = baseFee + maxPriorityFeePerGas < maxFeePerGas ? 
               baseFee + maxPriorityFeePerGas : 
               maxFeePerGas;
    Transaction Fee = Gas Price * Gas Used
    Transaction Weight = Gas Used * GasToWeight
    ```

=== "Legacy"
    ```text
    Transaction Fee = GasPrice * GasUsed
    Transaction Weight = GasUsed * GasToWeight
    ```

`GasToWeight` is a constant value set to `{{ templates.evm.gas_to_weight }}`.

# Framework Architecture {: #framework-architecture }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Substrate is a software development kit (SDK) for building blockchains. This framework is the foundation and engine powering many projects across the Web3 ecosystem, including the Tanssi network itself and the networks deployed through Tanssi.

Written in the Rust language and designed with a modular architecture, Substrate is extremely performant, flexible, and highly customizable, making it the best choice for developing blockchains.

In this article, the architecture of a Substrate node is covered.

## Architecture {: #architecture }

The Substrate framework is designed for maximum customizability, providing a fully functional implementation for every important internal aspect of a blockchain. It allows developers to focus on the specifics of the use case and the runtime characteristics, and it provides the ability to change any of the default features (should the need arise).

The architecture of a Substrate node contains two main components:

- **Core Client** - handles the communication with the outer world (other nodes, dApps, end users, among others), and many other internal responsibilities, such as storage and communication
- **Runtime** - implements the custom logic of the Tanssi network, executes transactions, and manages the state transitions

From the end-user perspective, all the interaction with the Tanssi network is usually made through dApps or directly via the node RPC endpoints, for example, using a wallet. When a user triggers a request to fetch data or sends transactions to a node, the core client is responsible for responding or queuing the transactions until execution in the runtime. Still, all these internal aspects of the node design are kept transparent to the user.

![Basic substrate node architecture](/images/learn/framework/architecture/architecture-1.webp)

## The Core Client {: #core-client }

The core client comprises components responsible for everything in the operation of a node in the network except for what happens in the runtime.

Some of the main components are:

- **Networking** - this component handles the communication with the peers in the network (synchronizing blocks, propagating transactions, and so on) and exposes the endpoints that allow dApps to integrate and interact with the Tanssi network
- **Storage** - this component manages the state storage of the Tanssi network in a highly efficient key-value database
- **Consensus** - this component ensures that all the participants in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, validating transactions, state transitions, and the resulting blocks

The default configuration of a Substrate node and the built-in implementations of the components are usually the best choice for most use cases. Still, teams are welcome to innovate and change or replace any piece of the node or even write a completely different implementation of the core client, such as [Kagome](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome#intro){target=\_blank} (C++ implementation) and [Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer#a-go-implementation-of-the-polkadot-host){target=\_blank} (Golang implementation).

## The Runtime {: #runtime }

The runtime plays a crucial role in the operation of the Tanssi network. It contains the core logic and rules to meet the requirements of the use case the developers are building, and, therefore, it is responsible for validating the transactions and executing the state transitions.

Being the core element in a Tanssi network, designing the Substrate architecture an important decision has been made regarding the format for the runtime: it is compiled to [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org){target=\_blank} byte code.

The Wasm format offers many advantages to a deployed Tanssi network, including:

- **Portability** - the Wasm format is platform-independent, meaning that the same binary can be distributed and run on different nodes using different hardware architectures and operating systems
- **Deterministic Execution** - the Wasm format ensures deterministic execution of code, which means that the same input will always produce the same output. Determinacy is a critical aspect in blockchains to obtain the same state transitions across every node in the network and reach a consensus
- **Forkless Upgradeability** - Substrate stores the runtime Wasm blob on-chain, meaning that the runtime itself becomes part of the state. This design allows upgrading the runtime logic in a forkless way using a transaction

Besides the format, internally, a Substrate runtime is built by composing different modules, either provided and ready-to-use by Substrate or custom-made. Each one of these modules define, among other things, the transactions they expose, the logic behind them, what needs to be stored in the chain state, the best format to do it, and how they cooperate with other modules composing functionality. More details about building a runtime will be covered in the [modules](/learn/framework/modules/){target=\_blank} section.

## Client-Runtime Communication {: #client-runtime-communication }

As previously described, the two main components of a Substrate node (the core client and the runtime) have a clear separation of concerns. Beyond the functional responsibilities, at a lower level, their binary representation and execution environments are different. While the node is compiled to be installed and run on a specific platform (be it Linux x64 or any other), the Tanssi network runtime is compiled to a Wasm format that is platform-agnostic and runs in an isolated execution environment.

Bearing in mind the separated execution environments, all the communication between the node client and the runtime occurs through a limited and well-defined interface, allowing the necessary operations such as:

- **Executing Transactions** - when a user submits a transaction to the client node, the node passes this transaction to the runtime through the defined API for its execution
- **State Queries** - the client node can query the current state of the blockchain to retrieve information such as account balances and any other domain-specific data
- **Consensus and Finality** - the client node coordinates consensus and finalization of the blocks, but it is the runtime's responsibility to determine the validity of new blocks, validate transactions, and ensure that the consensus rules are followed
- **Event Notifications** - the runtime emits events while executing transactions that the client node can use to keep external users updated about specific actions or changes in the state

# Network Framework Modules {: #network-framework-modules }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Substrate framework provides complete and ready-to-use implementations of the main functions a Tanssi network needs to work properly, including cryptography, consensus, governance, and so on. These implementations are fully customizable and could be replaced with custom logic if needed.

When building the Runtime, which defines the state transition rules between two blocks applied to a set of transactions, the intended behavior and features of the blockchain need to be set by determining the rules of the state transition.

To build the Runtime, Substrate provides many built-in modules (also known as pallets) that can be freely used as building blocks to compose and interact with any other custom-made modules, allowing teams to create unique behaviors according to the specific requirements of their Tanssi network.

![Built-in modules](/images/learn/framework/modules/modules-1.webp)

## Built-in Modules {: #built-in-modules }

When designing and writing the rules of a Tanssi network, the available set of functional modules brings a solution to many of the coding requirements that would otherwise need to be built from scratch.

Here is a list of some of the most popular modules:

- **[Balances](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions for handling accounts and balances for the Tanssi network native currency
- **[Assets](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_assets/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions for handling any type of fungible tokens
- **[NFTs](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nfts/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions for dealing with non-fungible tokens
- **[Democracy](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_democracy/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions to manage and administer general stakeholder voting
- **[Multisig](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_multisig/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions for multi-signature dispatch
- **[Recovery](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_recovery/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions to allow users to regain access to their accounts when the private key is lost. This works by granting other accounts the right to sign transactions on behalf of the lost account (note that it is necessary to have previously chosen the authorized accounts)
- **[Staking](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_staking/index.html){target=\_blank}** - it provides functions to administer staked tokens, support rewarding, slashing, depositing, withdrawing, and so on

In addition to those previously listed, other modules like [identity](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_identity/index.html){target=\_blank}, [smart contracts](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html){target=\_blank}, [vesting](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_vesting/index.html){target=\_blank}, and many others that are freely available can speed up the development of the Tanssi network and, consequently, the time to market.

!!! note
    The framework also includes other modules that provide core protocol functionality, such as consensus and low-level data encoding.

## Custom-Made Modules {: #custom-modules }

Developers creating new modules enjoy complete freedom to express any desired behavior in the core logic of the blockchain, like exposing new transactions, storing sensible information, and validating and enforcing business logic.

As explained in the [Architecture](/learn/framework/architecture/#client-runtime-communication){target=\_blank} article, a module needs to be able to communicate with the core client by exposing and integrating with a very specific API that allows the runtime to expose transactions, access storage, and code and decode information stored on-chain. It also needs to include many other required wiring codes that make the module work in the node.

To improve developer experience when writing modules, Substrate relies heavily on [Rust macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html){target=\_blank}. Macros are special instructions that automatically expand to Rust code just before compile-time, allowing modules to keep up to seven times the amount of code out of sight of the developers. This allows developers to focus on the specific functional requirements when writing modules instead of dealing with technicalities and the necessary scaffolding code.

All modules in Substrate, including custom-made ones, implement these attribute macros, of which the first three are mandatory:

- **`#[frame_support::pallet]`** - this attribute is the entry point that marks the module as usable in the runtime
- **`#[pallet::pallet]`** - applied to a structure that is used to retrieve module information easily
- **`#[pallet::config]`** - is a required attribute to define the configuration for the data types of the module
- **`#[pallet::call]`** -  this macro is used to define functions that will be exposed as transactions, allowing them to be dispatched to the runtime. It is here that the developers add their custom transactions and logic
- **`#[pallet::error]`** - as transactions may not be successful (insufficient funds, as an error example), and for security reasons, a custom module can never end up throwing an exception, all the possible errors are to be identified and listed in an enum to be returned upon an unsuccessful execution
- **`#[pallet::event]`** - events can be defined and used as a means to provide more information to the user
- **`#[pallet::storage]`** - this macro is used to define elements that will be persisted in storage. As resources are scarce in a blockchain, it should be used wisely to store only sensible information

All these macros act as attributes that must be applied to the code just above Rust modules, functions, structures, enums, types, etc., allowing the module to be built and added to the runtime, which, in time, will expose the custom logic to the outer world, as exposed in the following section.

### Custom Module Example { #custom-module-example }

As an example of a custom module, the following code (not intended for production use) showcases the use of the previously mentioned macros by presenting a simple lottery with minimal functionality, exposing two transactions:

- **buy_ticket** - this transaction verifies that the user signing the request has not already bought a ticket and has enough funds to pay for it. If everything is fine, the module transfers the ticket price to a special account and registers the user as a participant for the prize

- **award_prize** - this transaction generates a random number to pick the winner from the list of participants. The winner gets the total amount of the funds transferred to the module's special account

# Network Development Framework Overview {: #network-dev-framework-overview }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Building a network from scratch is a very complex task that requires deep knowledge in a wide range of areas, including (but not limited to):

- **Consensus Algorithms** - consensus ensures that all participants in the blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions. Some popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)

- **Cryptography** - cryptography plays a crucial role in securing the blockchain. You'll need cryptographic algorithms for tasks like creating digital signatures, verifying transactions, and encrypting data

- **Distributed Network** - a network architecture to enable nodes to communicate, validate transactions, and synchronize the blockchain data is key to maintaining a shared ledger in a decentralized network

- **Data Structures** - besides the list of blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions along with a reference to the previous block, an optimized and performant strategy to store the state of the network is needed

- **Governance** - if the network is designed to be permissionless, a voting mechanism is important in order to keep it evolving and reflecting the community will

- **Upgradeability** - it is necessary to clearly define how to upgrade, how modifications are implemented, and how conflicts are resolved within the network

Fortunately, there’s no need to build these blockchain components from scratch, thanks to an excellent open-source framework called [Substrate](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}. Tanssi itself is built with this framework, leveraging its comprehensive base implementations, modularity, and flexibility to achieve a high level of customization.

## Substrate Framework {: #substrate-framework}

Substrate is an extremely performant, flexible, modular, and highly customizable framework for building blockchains. This framework is the foundation and engine powering many projects across the Web3 ecosystem, including the Tanssi network itself and the networks deployed through Tanssi.

Many of its great features, such as performance, ease of use, and modularity, result from the programming language chosen for its development. This is where the [Rust Programming Language](#rust-programming-language) shines: It is fast, portable, and provides a wonderful model to handle memory, among other reasons detailed in the [next section](#rust-programming-language).

When developing a network, Substrate represents a great head start by providing a ready-to-use set of implementations of the main building blocks a project needs:

- **Consensus Algorithms** - there are multiple built-in consensus engines, such as Aura (Proof of Authority), Babe (Proof of Stake), and Grandpa (block finality), but due to the high degree of customization Substrate offers, teams can always choose to develop their specific consensus to adapt to the use case needs, as the Moonbeam team did with the [Nimbus Parachain Consensus Framework](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/features/consensus){target=\_blank}

- **Runtime Modules** - many built-in modules (explained in detail in the [modules](/learn/framework/modules/){target=\_blank} section) can be selected and configured into your network, such as accounts, balances, staking, governance, identity, and more

- **Networking** - built-in protocols and libraries for establishing connections, propagating transactions and blocks, synchronizing the blockchain state, and managing network interactions

- **Storage** - built-in storage mechanisms for efficient data storage and retrieval

- **Transaction Queue** - built-in transaction queue system that manages transaction validation, prioritization, and inclusion in blocks, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the network's state

- **RPC APIs** - Substrate provides Remote Procedure Call (RPC) APIs that enable external applications to interact with the network by querying blockchain data, submitting transactions, and accessing various functionalities exposed by the runtime

Every feature Substrate offers can be used as-is, extended, customized, or replaced to meet the specific requirements of the use case of the network.

Substrate streamlines and speeds up the process of developing new networks. When used in conjunction with Tanssi, which helps in handling the infrastructure and overseeing the deployment, the task of launching a new network becomes significantly simpler!

## Rust Programming Language {: #rust-programming-language}

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/){target=\_blank} is a programming language with features developers consistently rank highly in surveys like [Stack Overflow's annual developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/){target=\_blank}.

In addition to providing a great experience for developers, Rust excels in many areas:

- **Memory safety** - Rust compiler enforces strict compile-time checks to prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. Additionally, memory is managed through a novel system of ownership (checked by the compiler), which eliminates the necessity for a garbage collector

- **Performance** - Rust achieves performance comparable to that of C and C++ by providing low-level control over system resources and minimizing runtime overhead. It has a zero-cost abstraction principle, similar to "what you don't use, you don't pay for" from C++, meaning that abstractions have no extra overhead

- **Concurrency** - Rust has built-in features that make it easy to write concurrent and parallel code without introducing data races. It provides lightweight threads (tasks) and a powerful ownership model that ensures the safe sharing of data between threads

- **Expressive and safe abstractions** - Rust offers a rich set of modern language features, such as pattern matching, algebraic data types, closures, and type inference, allowing developers to write and read expressive and concise code. The Rust compiler enforces the strong type system, preventing many runtime errors at compile-time

- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Rust is designed to work well on a variety of platforms and architectures. It supports major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as embedded systems and WebAssembly. This versatility allows developers to write code that can be deployed across different environments

- **Growing ecosystem** - Rust has a rapidly growing ecosystem with a vibrant community and a rich collection of libraries and tools. The official package manager, Cargo, simplifies dependency management, building, and testing

- **Interoperability** - Rust provides seamless interoperability with existing codebases written in C and C++. It has a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that allows Rust code to interface with code written in other languages, enabling developers to gradually introduce Rust into existing projects, like the Linux kernel

title: Native Cross-Chain Communication
description: Tanssi networks benefit from XCM, a native cross-chain communication language, which allows fast and secure bridging guaranteed by Polkadot's relay chain.
categories: Basics

# Native Cross-Chain Communication

## Introduction {: #introduction }

All Tanssi-powered networks have an inherent capability to communicate and interoperate with any other network in the ecosystem. This native cross-chain communication feature is possible thanks to the unique infrastructure the networks are built on top of, leveraging the Cross-Consensus Message format (XCM for short), which facilitates communication between different consensus systems.

XCM is a messaging language designed to be generic. It doesn't make any assumptions about the destination chain and can communicate different intentions between sovereign consensus systems.

An XCM message is a program holding one or more instructions that will be relayed for execution to the destination chain. By itself, each XCM instruction is meaningless, but the combination of a specific set of instructions can result in a desired action when the XCM message is executed in the destination chain.

In this article, we cover the basic concepts of the native cross-chain communication mechanism that allows fast and secure bridging within the ecosystem.

## Design Principles {: #design-principles }

Conceived with an abstract mindset, XCM is not designed to comply with a specific use case or specific destination network setup, thus minimizing the coupling effect. Its core design principles are:

- **Asynchronous** - similar to sending a postcard -but way faster- the sender will keep performing its duties as usual, without blocking itself or awaiting a response from the destination
- **Absolute** -  messages are guaranteed to be delivered to the intended destination, in order and in a timely fashion
- **Asymmetric** -  messages sent have no response counterpart. Any return values, if required, must be sent back from the destination to the sender with another message
- **Agnostic** -  there are no assumptions whatsoever about the configuration or properties of two communicating networks. Networks might differ in every aspect, except the ability to understand XCM. E.g., one chain could be EVM-compatible and not the other, one chain could be a DeFi network and the other a gaming network, and so on

## Fees {: #fees }

A user executing a transaction on a network must pay the fees derived from computational effort associated with the task, and cross-chain execution is no exception to this rule. In cross-chain communication, a message requires execution on at least two different chains, and the user needs to pay for the fees associated with the computational effort made by every chain involved. Besides the execution-related costs, Tanssi networks include a default [delivery fee](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_common/xcm_sender/struct.ExponentialPrice.html){target=\_blank} to prevent XCM spamming.

For example, if a user on network A wants to call a smart contract on network B, the user must have enough funds to pay for the message delivery and include instructions in the XCM message to provide an asset that network B accepts as payment for its services to cover the associated fees. Once such an asset is provided, the execution can now be bought on the destination chain.

!!! note
    Since networks are sovereign, they get to decide which tokens are valid for paying their XCM execution fees.
    E.g., if network B accepts network A tokens for fee payments, any user on network A can pay for an XCM message destined for network B using only network A tokens.

## Common Use Cases {: #common-use-cases }

Many use cases can be addressed by benefiting from the common ground and versatility XCM provides. Two of the most recurrent ones are asset transfers and remote execution.

### Asset Transfers {: #asset-transfer }

Moving digital assets from one network to another is essential for creating a more dynamic, efficient, and interconnected blockchain ecosystem. The native cross-chain capability allows two main strategies to transfer assets from one chain to another:

- **Teleport** - teleporting an asset is a simple and efficient mechanism, but it has a major caveat: it requires trust between the parties. In essence, when network A wants to send X amount of assets to network B, it burns X amount of assets and sends a message to network B instructing them to mint exactly X amount of assets, preserving the overall asset balance and concluding the teleport action. In this process, network A trusts network B not to mint more tokens than what was transferred, and network B trusts network A to burn the tokens that were transferred
- **Reserve transfer** - A reserve transfer involves the **reserve chain** of an asset, which is the chain where the asset is native (e.g., [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/){target=\_blank} is the reserve chain for the GLMR token). Also, non-reserve networks hold a *sovereign account* on the reserve chain, a keyless account managed by the respective network governor. Thus, when reserve network A wants to send X amount of an asset to non-reserve network B, it locally transfers the assets to network's B sovereign account and, in the same atomic action, it sends an XCM message to network B with instructions to mint X amount of a derivative form of the transferred asset. On the other way around, if non-reserve network B wants to send X amount of an asset to reserve network A, then the steps are: network B burns the derived form of the asset locally and sends an XCM message to network A, with instructions to transfer the assets from network B's sovereign account to network's A destination account. Even if the non-reserve network mints derived tokens in excess (or doesn't burn tokens when transferring), these tokens will have no real value because they are not backed one-to-one in the reserve chain

The associated fees for executing transfers are typically deducted from the transferred amount, so the recipient receives the intended amount minus the fees.

### Remote Execution {: #remote-execution }

The native interoperability XCM provides allows a network to send a message to another triggering some action. For example, If the destination chain is EVM-compatible, network A can call a smart contract deployed on network B.

As mentioned in the [fees section](#fees), to get any on-chain request executed it is necessary to cover its associated fees. On XCM, remote execution can be bought with two steps:

1. Reserve some assets using the `WithdrawAsset` XCM instruction, which takes funds from the call origin and puts them in a holding register
2. Pay for the on-chain execution, using the `BuyExecution` XCM instruction, which uses the previously withdrawn assets

!!! note
    When a network sends an XCM message, its default source on the receiving end is the origin network's Sovereign account. The sender network can add an XCM instruction called `DescendOrigin` to the message, changing the origin account to match the signing user's account, ensuring execution occurs on behalf of the same entity initiating the XCM message on the source chain, and avoiding a potentially unsafe scenario.

Finally, the execution takes place on the destination chain, calling a smart contract or any other transaction using the XCM instruction called `Transact`.

The general flow for remote execution is represented in the following diagram:

![Remote Execution Flow](/images/learn/framework/xcm/xcm-1.webp)

## Establishing Cross-Chain Communication {: #channel-registration }

Before two chains can communicate, a messaging channel must be established. Channels are unidirectional, which means that separate channels are needed to send messages from chain A to chain B and B to A.

For chain A to communicate with chain B, chain A must send an open channel transaction to the relay chain requesting a channel be opened with chain B. Chain B must then accept the request by sending a corresponding XCM message to the relay chain. Only when both chains agree is the channel opened in the next epoch. The same process is required to establish a channel from chain B to chain A.

It is important to note that a channel between a network and the relay chain is automatically opened upon network registration and onboarding.

![XCM Channel Registration Overview](/images/learn/framework/xcm/xcm-2.webp)

Once the channel is established, cross-chain messages can be sent between networks. For asset transfers, assets will also need to be registered before being transferred.

!!! note
    XCM is a versioned, ever-evolving language. When two communicating networks use different XCM versions, they must use the latest version supported by the less upgraded side. To find out the latest XCM version a network can work with, other networks can query it and subscribe for updates whenever this changes.

## Message Destinations {: #message-destinations }

To compose meaningful messages in a multichain environment it is necessary to have a precise yet abstract way of referencing resources located in different consensus systems. A concept called *multilocation* is used to serve this purpose and target a specific chain or any of its inner elements, such as an account, an asset, or a smart contract.

XCM's destination elements are organized in a hierarchical architecture, where elements are contained within other components. For example, a smart contract is an element contained within a network, and the same can be said for an account or an ERC20 asset. Networks are contained by the relay chain, which plays a crucial role in the cross-chain messaging process, relaying messages from one network to another.

Multilocations are not a universal resource locator. They refer to elements from the sender's perspective and are composed of two components: `parents` and `interior`. Parents is a property that indicates if the route must "move up" in the hierarchy, i.e., from a network to the relay chain. Interior is a list of junctions that define how to locate the destination. Here are some examples of multilocations:

- **Network A references a smart contract in network B** - from the point of view of network A, to reach a smart contract in network B it is necessary to move up in the hierarchy (to the relay chain) and then descend to network B to, once there, reference the smart contract's address. The multilocation is therefore defined with a `parents` value set to `1`, which moves up, and two junctions, one defining which network should receive the message, and the other defining the H160 address of the smart contract that will be called

![Smart Contract Multilocation Example](/images/learn/framework/xcm/xcm-3.webp)

- **Network A references an account in the relay chain** - from the point of view of network A, to reference an account in the relay chain, it is necessary to move up and then reference the account. The multilocation is defined with a `parents` value set to `1`, which moves up to the relay chain, and one junction that references the substrate type destination address

# Accounts in the Tanssi Protocol

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Blockchain technology relies on [public-private](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography){target=\_blank} key cryptography for secure asset ownership and transaction verification. Private keys authorize transactions, while public keys serve as addresses for verification. Due to the Tanssi protocol's hybrid [Substrate](/learn/framework/overview/#substrate-framework){target=\_blank} and Ethereum nature, understanding the different account types is crucial for users and operators.

## Account Types in the Tanssi Protocol {: #key-types-in-tanssi-protocol }

| **Account Type** | **Underlying Algorithm** | **Primary Use in Tanssi** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Sr25519](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/){target=_blank} | Schnorr signatures on the Ristretto group | Default signature scheme for Substrate-based transactions and operator identity. |
| [Ed25519](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-cryptography/){target=_blank} | EdDSA using Curve25519 | Used for specific consensus roles (e.g., block production, finality) within the Substrate framework. |
| [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm){target=_blank} | Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm | Receiving rewards through the Ethereum-based Symbiotic protocol for operators. |

## Identity and Operations { : #identity-and-operations }

Tanssi, built with the Substrate framework, utilizes distinct cryptographic schemes for different functions, primarily _Sr25519_ and _Ed25519_. These account types are crucial for interacting with the protocol's Substrate components by signing transactions.

**Sr25519 (Schnorrkel/Ristretto x25519)** - is the primary account type used for most user-facing operations within Tanssi. Its strengths lie in security and efficiency. **Sr25519 accounts serve as your on-chain identity, used for holding tokens, participating in governance, paying transaction fees, and other general interactions with the network.** When you create a wallet to interact with Tanssi as a regular user, you will create and use an Sr25519 account.

**Ed25519 (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** - while Sr25519 handles general identity and transactions, Ed25519 is specifically leveraged for its high performance in cryptographic signing, making it ideal for consensus-related operations. **Within Tanssi, Ed25519 accounts are used by node operators for critical consensus mechanisms, such as block production and finality.** Regular users will typically not create or directly use an Ed25519 account. However, these accounts are fundamental for the security and operation of the network, managed by those running nodes.

Node operators on Tanssi require a Substrate account to record their activities, including operators who secure the network and sequencers who produce blocks. This account also tracks rewards, with session keys mapped to it for enhanced security.

## Security and Rewards on Ethereum { : #security-and-rewards-on-ethereum }

The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is fundamental to Ethereum and is used by Tanssi to integrate with the Ethereum network via Symbiotic. This partnership leverages Ethereum's security for Tanssi-powered networks.

Tanssi operators need an ECDSA account to receive rewards distributed on Ethereum, likely through the Symbiotic protocol. The necessity of both Substrate and ECDSA accounts highlights Tanssi's hybrid design, where operations are Substrate-based, and security and rewards are linked to Ethereum.

## Account Mappings in Tanssi { : #account-mappings-in-tanssi}

### Internal Key Binding (_Sr25519_ and _Ed25519_)

Within Tanssi's Substrate-based protocol, an operator’s primary _Sr25519_ identity links to specific _Ed25519_ keys used for consensus tasks (like block production). Operators create this binding with an on-chain transaction. This transaction maps their internal public keys ("session keys") with the stash account. This on-chain registration ensures the network correctly attributes all actions from the session keys to the operator's primary identity.

### Cross-Ecosystem Reward Mapping (_Sr25519_ and _ECDSA_)

For rewards on Ethereum (e.g., via [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}), an operator's Tanssi _Sr25519_ identity maps to an Ethereum _ECDSA_ address. Operators inform both accounts, which are then linked through the Tanssi middleware. This trusted link ensures that rewards from the operator's node work on the Tanssi network are routed to the operator's designated Ethereum account.

# Ethereum with Symbiotic {: #ethereum-symbiotic }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Tanssi protocol takes care of critical infrastructural components, making it easy for developers to launch their networks in a few minutes. In addition to block production, data retrievability, and integrations with essential tools such as wallets, RPC endpoints, block explorers, and others, another major task to tackle is providing security to the network.

Tanssi is designed to offer developers a shared security model, alleviating them from having to source enough economic security or negotiating with operators to run nodes opting-in for their networks. By deploying networks through Tanssi, and by choosing [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} as a security provider, developers benefit from Ethereum-grade security, tapping into billions of dollars in shared security from staked ETH.

The following sections describe how the Symbiotic protocol works and how Tanssi networks can leverage it as their consensus mechanism.

## Ethereum-Grade Security with Symbiotic {: #symbiotic }

[Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} is a shared security protocol designed to be permissionless, multi-asset, and network-agnostic. It fosters capital efficiency by allowing users to extend the functionality of their staked assets to secure other networks while providing additional utility.

The protocol provides a coordination layer for its main components and participants, aligning incentives among parties while minimizing execution layer risks by deploying non-upgradeable core contracts on Ethereum. The following diagram resumes all the components and actors participating in the protocol:

    end

    Vaults <--> Tanssi
    Tanssi <--> Operators
    Tanssi <--> Networks
```

Symbiotic's flexible design allows every party to decide on setups that best fit their use cases. For example, vaults can choose what forms of collateral they accept, operators can determine which networks they want to provide services to, and decentralized networks can customize their use case and define the level of security (which collaterals are accepted, for example) they need.

The following sections describe the protocol's main components.

### Vaults {: #vaults }

[Vaults](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/vault/introduction){target=\_blank} are the Symbiotic protocol's economic backbone. They manage liquidity and deposits from restakers, connect operators and networks, and set up delegation strategies.

Each vault is bound to a specific token that satisfies the [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-20.md){target=\_blank} interface and is accepted as collateral. Internally, the funds within the vault are represented as shares, which provide a mechanism for tracking ownership and distributing rewards. However, the reward token may differ from the collateral token.

A vault comprises three key modules, each serving a distinct function: the slasher, the delegator, and the accounting module. The implementation of these modules can vary depending on the vault manager's decisions.

- **Slasher module** - implements the [slashing](#slashing-process) logic, which penalizes bad actors
- **Delegator module** - defines how funds are delegated across operators and networks. Several [strategies](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/vault/delegator){target=\_blank} are available, allowing the vault manager to select which operators and networks they want to work with
- **Accounting module** - handles the vault's financial operations, including processing user deposits, managing withdrawal requests, tracking active balances and total supply, and implementing epoch-based accounting for withdrawals and slashing events. The accounting module's standard implementation is [ERC-4626](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/){target=\_blank}, which provides a vault with a shares system included

Since the operators get delegated stake from the vault and could potentially get slashed, they must be approved by the vault managers beforehand. On a similar note, vault managers analyze and authorize each network the vault will secure, considering, for example, the rewards the network offers.

Vault managers also designate [resolvers](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/counterparties/resolvers){target=\_blank}, responsible for approving or vetoing [slashing events](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/vault/slasher){target=\_blank} caused by operators on networks with [veto-slashing](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/vault/slasher#veto-slashing){target=\_blank} support, like the Tanssi Network.

### Operators {: #operators }

[Node operators](/node-operators/){target=\_blank} are entities or individuals responsible for running the [nodes (also known as operators or validators)](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/counterparties/operators){target=\_blank}, which are the computational components validating the networks' transactions. They are responsible for the nodes' configuration, hardware setup, uptime, and performance.

Node operators opt-in to provide services to networks, which must accept their request. Also, they opt-in to provide services in vaults, which must accept their request.

Once an operator has been accepted by a vault and a network connected to that vault, the node can start providing validation services to that network, receiving rewards in exchange.

### Networks {: #networks }

[Networks](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/modules/counterparties/networks){target=\_blank} are the actively validated services or networks. These application-specific blockchains can be a use case from a wide range of industries, such as Gaming, Defi, RWAs, and others, and are the platforms that, through dApps, the end users interact with.

Since operators opt-in to provide services to networks and the vault managers must accept the networks, the developers are responsible for defining, controlling, and adapting their methodology for onboarding, rewarding, and slashing operators.

!!! note
    Networks deployed through Tanssi don't need to work on the relation with vaults and operators since the Tanssi protocol deals with those complexities.

## Tanssi with Symbiotic {: #tanssi-symbiotic }

Developers launching networks through Tanssi benefit from [block production services](/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/){target=\_blank}, data retrievability as a service, and the shared security model derived from every vault opting-in to support the Tanssi protocol. This eliminates the hurdle of dealing with infrastructural and security components developers would need to take on otherwise.

Vault managers running vaults can apply to offer the restaked collaterals as economic security for the Tanssi Network. Since Tanssi networks run in a sandbox-like environment, and the Tanssi protocol manages all the networks-related responsibilities, vault managers only need to analyze and opt-in to the Tanssi protocol, regardless of the quality and the quantity of networks that are running through the Tanssi protocol at any given moment.

Operators opting-in to provide services to the Tanssi protocol (provided that they participate in a vault that supports the Tanssi protocol) have the benefit of running the same setup to provide block production and validation services to the Tanssi Network and, consequently, to every network deployed through Tanssi. This unique architecture facilitates all the tasks related to running and maintaining the operators since there are no changes in the setup when a new Tanssi network is launched or decommissioned.

!!! note
    The Tanssi protocol effectively abstracts the details of the active set of networks away from vault managers and operators. Networks particularities don't require any additional setup from operators nor pose risks to vault assets.

All things combined shape a functional and elegant ecosystem where developers can focus on creating and innovating. Tanssi handles the infrastructural components, guaranteeing liveness and performance, and Symbiotic provides the economic safeguards to ensure the validity of the operations.

```

### Tanssi-Ethereum Communication {: #tanssi-ethereum-communication }

It is important to learn how Tanssi and Ethereum exchange data to understand the mechanics of the protocol. They connect through a two-way bridge that lets them communicate with each other. Each protocol has a specific job in making cross-chain operations possible.

There are three key components between Symbiotic and Tanssi:

```mermaid
flowchart LR

Tanssi["Tanssi"] <--> Relayer 
Relayer <--> Gateway 
Gateway["Gateway"] <--> Middleware
Middleware <--> Symbiotic["Symbiotic"]

class Tanssi tanssiNode;

class Middleware middlewareNode;

class Gateway gatewayNode;

class Symbiotic symbioticNode;

class Relayer relayerNode;
```

- **`Relayer`** - is the software that continuously monitors both blockchains and transmits messages. Enabling reliable bidirectional communication between Tanssi and Ethereum, serving as the connection layer that ensures messages are correctly delivered across networks

- **`Gateway`** - operates on the Ethereum side of the bridge and serves three essential functions. It receives, verifies, and routes incoming messages from Tanssi to ensure they are correctly processed. The contract accepts outgoing messages destined for the Tanssi network, preparing them for relay. Finally, it handles higher-level application functionalities, most notably token transfers between the two networks, providing a secure interface for cross-chain asset movement

- **`Middleware`** - is Tanssi's implementation for handling network events and operations. It is the critical link between the `Gateway` and Tanssi's core protocol

The `Middleware` plays a central role in network coordination between Tanssi and Symbiotic. It distributes rewards to operators and vaults based on their network security and performance contributions. The contract sorts operators by stake to create a merit-based ranking system for their selection and transmits the list of sorted operator keys to Tanssi for assignment. Additionally, it facilitates operator registration processes and handles the reward and slashing protocols that maintain network incentive alignment.

#### From Ethereum to Tanssi {: #from-ethereum-tanssi }

The `Middleware` transmits operator set information to Tanssi for session assignment through the bridge. It sends details about active operators for each epoch, ordering them by their total stake aggregated across vaults. Tanssi then uses this information to assign operators for upcoming sessions, ensuring that the most economically aligned ones secure the network. This mechanism creates a stake-weighted operator selection process where economic security on Ethereum translates to operational security on Tanssi.

#### From Tanssi to Ethereum {: #from-tanssi-ethereum }

Tanssi sends operational data back to Ethereum through the same communication channel. This message includes reward information that enables proper distribution to stakeholders based on network performance. The network also transmits slashing event data when operators fail to perform correctly or violate protocol rules, allowing the protocol to apply penalties. Tanssi can also request new tokens to be created on Ethereum and register tokens, making managing assets between both networks easy.

### Rewards {: #rewards }

Well-behaved operators and restakers are rewarded for their participation with TANSSI tokens. The reward process consists of two main phases: [Reward Distribution Phase](#reward-distribution-phase) and [Reward Claiming Phase](#reward-claiming-phase).

#### Reward Distribution Phase {: #reward-distribution-phase }

The reward distribution phase calculates and allocates rewards through five key steps involving operators, restakers, and smart contracts. The steps are:

1. **Reward Calculation** - Tanssi calculates rewards based on the activity of operators and stakers and then creates a [Merkle root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree){target=\_blank}. This Merkle root is a cryptographic fingerprint that summarizes the reward allocations, indicating who receives what. Stakers are rewarded according to their stake in each vault
2. **Reward Data Sent via XCM** - reward allocation data is sent using [XCM](https://wiki.polkadot.com/learn/learn-xcm/){target=\_blank} (Cross-Consensus Messaging), a standardized protocol for blockchain communication. [Snowbridge](https://docs.snowbridge.network/){target=\_blank} acts as a trustless bridge between Tanssi and Ethereum
3. **Ethereum Message Reception** - once the message is relayed to the `Gateway` contract, this contract serves as Tanssi's authorized entry point on Ethereum for the Snowbridge bridge
4. **Message Processing and Validation** - the `Gateway` forwards the data to the [`Middleware`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi-symbiotic/blob/main/src/contracts/middleware/Middleware.sol){target=\_blank}, which is responsible for various tasks, including passing the information to the `OperatorReward` contract
5. **Reward Storage and Distribution** - this is the final destination for the data. The [`OperatorRewards`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi-symbiotic/blob/main/src/contracts/rewarder/ODefaultOperatorRewards.sol){target=\_blank} contract stores the Merkle tree of the reward allocations and handles the transfer of reward tokens when a claim is made

    Gateway ->>Middleware: 4. Message processing and validation
    Middleware->>OperatorRewards: 5. Reward storage and distribution
```

#### Reward Claiming Phase {: #reward-claiming-phase }

In the reward-claiming phase, operators and stakers can claim rewards based on their participation in the network. Tanssi determines the share distribution for operators and stakers, currently setting it at 20% for operators and 80% for stakers.

1. **Operator Reward Claim** - operators can claim their share by calling the `OperatorRewards` contract by using a cryptographic receipt that verifies their entitlement
2. **Token Release** - the operator call triggers the token release, and the `OperatorRewards` sends the established amount to the operator
3. **Token Distribution to Stakers** - the remaining rewards are forwarded to the `StakerRewards` contract for further claiming of the staker
4. **Staker Allocation** - the remaining 80% of the rewards are automatically directed to the [`StakerRewards`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi-symbiotic/blob/main/src/contracts/rewarder/ODefaultStakerRewards.sol){target=\_blank} contract, where stakers can claim rewards proportional to their stake in the vaults

 OperatorRewards->>Operator: 2. Release rewards to the operator
 OperatorRewards->>StakerRewards: 3. Forward the remainder to StakerRewards
 Stakers->>StakerRewards: 4. Stakers claim individual rewards
```

### Slashing {: #slashing }

The Tanssi protocol implements slashing to penalize operators for misbehavior. When a slashing event is triggered, the authorities designated as resolvers by the vault managers can either accept or revert this action.

The following actions can trigger slashing events:

- Producing invalid blocks (e.g., blocks that include invalid transactions)
- Invalid validation (e.g., double-signing or breaking protocol rules)
- Downtime or unavailability
- Consensus violations

!!!note
    Slashing events can only be triggered by operators' misbehavior within the Tanssi Network. Even if Tanssi networks are faulty or malicious, they operate in a sandboxed environment and cannot cause slashing.

#### Slashing Process {: #slashing-process }

The slashing process follows a path similar to that of rewards. When an operator misbehaves, the Tanssi Network sends a slashing request message to the trustless bridge (Snowbridge). The message passes through the `Gateway` and into the `Middleware` where the slashing method gets called.

The slashing method receives a unique identifier for the operator's identity, the severity of the slash as a percentage of the operator's assigned stake in each vault, and the time context within which the offense occurred.

The slashing process consists of the following steps:

1. **Slash Reported** - Tanssi sends the slash request to the `Middleware` with the parameters `operatorKey`, `percentage`, and `epoch`
2. **Operator Validation** - the `Middleware` validates the operator's identity and checks if the operator is subject to slashing
3. **Retrieve Active Vaults** - the `Middleware` iterates through all active vaults during the offense epoch, skipping any inactive vaults
4. **Retrieve Operator Stake** - for each active vault, the `Middleware` retrieves the stake of the misbehaving operator
5. **Calculate Slash Amount** - the `Middleware` calculates the slashing amount by applying the slashed percentage to the operator's stake in each vault
6. **Slashing** - depending on the vault's slashing implementation, there are two possible routes

    - **Instant Slashing** - if the vault uses instant slashing, the stake is immediately reduced

    - **Veto Slashing** - if the vault uses veto slashing, the `Middleware` requests the slashing from a resolver. A time-limited veto window is created (e.g., 7 days)

    The slashing is canceled if the resolver vetoes the request within the time window. Otherwise, the slashing penalty is executed if no veto occurs within the time window

This process ensures that each vault's slashing is handled independently, preventing cross-contamination, and offers both instant and time-delayed slashing with dispute resolution mechanisms.

            opt If Not Vetoed
                Slasher->>Slasher: 6.2 Execute slash
            end
        end
    end
```

#### Burner {: #burner }

The `Burner` contract is an extension responsible for handling actions that follow a [slashing event](#slashing-process), notably the burning of slashed collateral. Once a slash is executed, the `Slasher` contract calls the `Burner` to carry out these post-slashing tasks.

Within the protocol, the `Burner` contract plays a crucial role in deciding what happens after slashing. While there are different ways to implement the burning process, the recommended approach is to burn the slashed assets.
When a slash is executed, the `Burner` contract's `onSlash` function is activated. This function kicks off the process of burning the slashed assets.

The vault manager chooses the specific implementation of the burning process during the vault's initialization phase, and once set, the vault manager cannot modify it. The exact design of the `Burner` contract may differ depending on the type of collateral asset involved. Below are some potential implementation options:

- **Burning Tokens** - if the slashed collateral is a regular ERC-20 token, the `Burner` destroys those tokens, permanently removing them from circulation
- **Unwrapping and Burning** - if the slashed tokens represent something like staked assets (e.g., liquid staking tokens) or liquidity provider (LP) tokens from a decentralized exchange (DEX), the `Burner` might convert them back into their original form before burning them
- **Cross-Chain Operations** - if the tokens are tied to assets on another blockchain, the `Burner` could unwrap them on Ethereum and trigger the burn process on the original network
- **Alternative Handling** - sometimes, burning isn't the best option. Instead, the `Burner` might redistribute the slashed assets to other operators, compensate affected users, or lock them in liquidity pools—whatever the system is designed to do

Burning slashed collateral is important because it penalizes misbehaving operators and reduces the total supply of tokens, which can have deflationary effects.

# Tanssi Staking for Block Production {: #tanssi-staking }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

One of Tanssi's core propositions is to simplify the infrastructure complexity for networks. A significant component is bootstrapping a decentralized set of sequencers, which Tanssi offers through its unique architecture and staking mechanics.

Tanssi staking mechanics guarantee that the sequencers for Tanssi-powered networks are selected through a trustless and decentralized mechanism. They also incentivize the community to delegate to top-performing or engaged sequencers.

This page covers the fundamental concepts of Tanssi's staking mechanics and how it secures a decentralized block production set that drives network liveness for Tanssi networks.

  </a>
</div>

## Core Concepts {: #core-concepts }

Tanssi's staking module mechanics were inspired by the concept of liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) in traditional Automated-Market-Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap V2.

Each sequencer has four liquidity pools through which delegators move as they perform different staking operations. In short, each liquidity pool represents a different state throughout the staking process: joining, staking through manual rewards, staking through auto-compound rewards, and leaving. Nevertheless, one core difference is that LP tokens in common AMMs are transferable while staking shares tokens are not.

A delegator has four simple transactions to go through the different states (liquidity pools): delegate (for manual or auto-compound rewards), undelegate, swap, and execute pending operations. For example, users who want to stake through either rewards pool can use the delegate call and join the Joining Pool immediately. After a delay, users (or anyone else) can execute the pending operation and enter the initially set rewards pool. Once there, users can swap between reward pools as often as they like. Lastly, users in a rewards pool can use the undelegate call to go into the Leaving Pool and unstake their tokens (or anyone else's) executing the pending operation after a given delay.

Liquidity pools have a set of shares that can be considered LP tokens in traditional AMMs. When users join a new liquidity pool, they are given several shares (LP tokens) that depend on the pool type, the number of tokens they staked, the total number of shares, and the total number of tokens staked in that pool.

Rewards are assigned to a sequencer's Manual or Auto-Compound Reward Pools when Tanssi attests that the specific block production slot that sequencer was assigned to has been fulfilled, and the block was produced successfully.

All rewards (for all pools) are stored in a protocol-owned account. Nevertheless, the protocol internally keeps track of the actual native tokens held by each pool. The core difference between staking through the Manual or Auto-Compound Rewards Pools is how rewards are distributed. In the Manual Rewards Pool, users have to claim any staking rewards they've accumulated manually. In contrast, in the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool, the rewards are automatically re-staked at each Tanssi block, where the protocol announces the sequencer for each block production assignment.

The delegate and undelegate operations need to be sent by the delegator itself. They signal the intent of the action to be taken and ask the protocol to perform the necessary checks to allow the delegator to delegate or undelegate. Consequently, these actions can be executed only after a certain number of sessions, but anyone in the network can perform this second operation through the execute pending operation transaction.

The following diagram summarizes the high-level flow of a delegator delegating and undelegating tokens to a sequencer. User actions are highlighted in cyan, while different pools are highlighted in coral.

## Staking Pools {: #staking-pools}

The following section goes through each of the liquidity pools that represent a step throughout the staking process.

### Joining Pool {: $joining-pool}

When a user first delegates to start the staking process, it must state what staking rewards mechanism it wants: manual or auto-compound rewards (each being a separate pool). Once the joining transaction is executed, the user automatically enters the Joining Pool and is given shares of that pool directly correlated to the number of tokens being staked. This pool offers stability to the current set of sequencers by providing a delay between a delegator staking and receiving rewards. The delay is set to at least one entire session.

As a practical example, Alice starts the staking process targeting the Manual Rewards Pool and enters the Joining Pool halfway through a session; she must wait until the end of the next session to execute her pending operation to start receiving staking rewards.

Joining Pools for each sequencer have a one-to-one ratio of shares per token staked. Therefore, if Alice is staking 100 tokens, she will receive 100 shares (LP tokens) of the Joining Pool she entered. When her delegate pending operation is executed, the protocol consumes her shares of the Joining Pool in favor of native protocol tokens, which are immediately swapped to shares in either the Manual Rewards or Auto-Compound Rewards Pools.

The following diagrams assumes a user is staking into the Manual Rewards Pool.

![High-level overview of the Joining Pool when Staking](/images/learn/tanssi/staking/staking-2.webp)


### Manual Rewards Pool {: #manual-rewards-pool}

When a user joins the Manual Rewards Pool, the protocol destroys all Joining Pool shares they own in favor of the native protocol token. Next, in the same block, the protocol computes the amount of Manual Pool shares that can be minted with this amount based on the share's price. The price is calculated based on current pool conditions, that is, the number of native tokens and shares that exist:

```mathematica
SharePrice [Tokens/Shares] = NumberOfTokensInPool / NumberOfSharesInPool 
```

Shares don't have decimals. Consequently, any remaining native tokens when acquiring the pool's shares are refunded to the user. The share price is not impacted by users joining the pool, as the ratio is maintained. Once the user has Manual Rewards Pool shares, they earn staking rewards (that is, in the same session) that need to be claimed manually by the user delegating. 

In contrast to the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool, where reward distribution is done automatically to the specific pool, the distribution for the Manual Rewards Pools operates through a counter checkpoint rewards mechanism. This mechanism tracks the historical native token per share distribution rate assigned to you by the protocol for that particular Manual Reward Pool at a specific point in time. When Tanssi attests that a block was produced by a given sequencer, new rewards are assigned to that Manual Rewards Pool for users to claim, and the rewards counter increases. Therefore, rewards are reflected as the ratio of native tokens per share you receive as staking rewards, which is the difference between the current pool's rewards counter and your original rewards counter checkpoint.

Consequently, the native tokens per share rewards counter plays a vital role in the protocol's calculation of the tokens the user is due when they claim their rewards. Once the rewards are calculated, the protocol sends them from the protocol-owned account to the user. Simultaneously, the user's rewards counter checkpoint is reset to the current one set by the pool current counter value. This reset is necessary to ensure the user's new rewards counter aligns and that the due rewards are zero.

Similarly, when a user stakes or unstakes tokens, rewards are automatically claimed, and the user's checkpoint rewards counter is reset. Adding or removing a stake means that reward conditions for that specific amount differ from what the protocol has in storage. Consequently, the rewards counter checkpoint must be synced with the pool's rewards counter to ensure no imbalances.

![High-level overview of the Manual Rewards Pool when Staking](/images/learn/tanssi/staking/staking-3.webp)

### Auto-Compound Rewards Pool {: #autocompounded-rewards-pool}

When a user joins the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool, the protocol destroys all Joining Pool shares they own in favor of the native protocol token. Next, in the same block, the protocol computes the amount of Auto-Compound shares that can be minted with this amount based on the share's price. The price is calculated based on current pool conditions, that is, the amount of native tokens and shares that exist:

```mathematica
SharePrice [Tokens/Shares] = NumberOfTokensInPool / NumberOfSharesInPool 
```

Shares don't have decimals. Consequently, any remaining native tokens when acquiring the pool's shares are refunded to the user. The share price is not impacted by users joining the pool, as the ratio is maintained. Once the user has Auto-Compound Rewards Pool shares, they earn staking rewards (that is, in the same session).

In contrast to the Manual Rewards Pool, native token rewards in the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool are automatically assigned to the pool at each Tanssi block where the protocol attests the sequencer for each block production assignment in any Tanssi-powered network. Consequently, as the number of native tokens held in the pool increases but the number of shares stays constant, the share price increases (according to the formula). Therefore, if the users redeem their shares for native tokens, they will receive more native tokens per share than when they joined the pool.

![High-level overview of the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool when Staking](/images/learn/tanssi/staking/staking-4.webp)

Native token rewards are automatically assigned as new stake into the Auto-Compound Rewards Pool, hence the auto-compounding nature of this specific staking pool mechanism.

Nevertheless, when auto-compound staking rewards are assigned, they are not held in the user's reserved balance, as the protocol-owned account still has them. The increase in the delegator's stake is indirectly represented by the share price increase. However, in specific scenarios, a user might want to let the protocol know that they want that balance to be represented in their state as reserved balance, for example, for governance purposes. 

Consequently, the protocol offers a specific transaction any user can submit to update the reserve balance of any delegate. This call moves the auto-compound rewards for the specified user from the protocol-owned account to their reserve balance. This is also automatically executed by the protocol when a user removes liquidity from a Auto-Compound Rewards Pool.

### Leaving Pool {: #leaving-pool}

When a user decides to exit their staking positions from a Manual or Auto-Compound Reward Pool, they have the power to initiate an undelegation. This process, similar to when they initially entered the Joining Pool, is a two-step journey. The user signs an intent to remove a specific delegation and patiently waits for at least one entire session before the operation can be executed by anyone.

Upon executing the leaving transaction intent, the protocol exchanges shares of the specified pool for native tokens at the current pool price. For the Manual Rewards Pool, any unclaimed rewards are assigned to the user. Simultaneously, the protocol purchases Leaving Pool shares in a one-to-one ratio for the native tokens the user just received. This ensures that the user joins the Leaving Pool, acquiring shares that correspond to the number of native tokens they desire to unstake.

After an entire session passes, any user can execute the pending operation. Then, the protocol swaps Leaving Pool shares for native protocol tokens at a one-to-one ratio.

The primary purpose of the Leaving Pool is to provide a buffer for users leaving the staking mechanics. This buffer allows the implementation of slashing mechanisms to deter bad behavior. Slashing has not been implemented in Tanssi but could be implemented in the future.

The following diagrams assumes a user is unstaking from the Manual Rewards Pool.

![High-level overview of the Leaving Pool when Staking](/images/learn/tanssi/staking/staking-5.webp)

### Swapping Between Rewards Pools {: #swap-rewards-pool}

Tanssi's staking module allows users to swap their stake from one type of reward pool to another. Users can use this functionality to move partial or full amounts of the staked tokens in a specific pool. The main benefit is that users don't have to go through the Leaving Pool and the Joining Pool again to move their stake.

First, all pending Manual Rewards Pool rewards are claimed at a protocol level, as liquidity is either added or removed. Therefore, the checkpoint rewards counter needs to be synced with the pool. Next, shares from the original pool are consumed and exchanged in favor of native protocol tokens at the current pool price. Then, shares of the new pool are attained at that pool's price. Lastly, any dust tokens remaining are automatically exchanged in favor of Leaving Pool shares. Note that all of the above is executed in the same block, and users don't have to wait for delays to earn rewards in the new pool. The dust in the Leaving Pool can be claimed after the required delays have passed.

# Block Production Services {: #block-production-services }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

As presented in the [Overview](/learn/tanssi/overview/){target=\_blank} article, Tanssi is an infrastructure protocol that streamlines the deployment of decentralized networks with custom logic fitting a wide range of use cases, including DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, and any other use case development teams may want to address.

Infrastructure poses a huge challenge for developers, requiring them to bootstrap sequencers, data preservers, and RPC endpoints, while also managing integrations, interoperability, and security. This demands valuable time and resources, diverting focus from what truly matters: delivering value to their users.

Tanssi orchestrates resources, allowing developers to deploy decentralized networks (also known as actively validated services or AVSs) that are fully adaptable to any specific application or use case. In this analogy, the Tanssi network resembles [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io){target=\_blank} in its role as an orchestrator, managing resources to guarantee the liveness and performance of the networks.

The protocol also tackles the security front by allowing networks to select and connect to external security providers (like [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}), ensuring Ethereum-grade security right from the start.

This article covers the necessary aspects to consider when building and deploying your own modular blockchain, along with the most relevant technical aspects of the Tanssi protocol.

## Block Production as a Service {: #block-production-as-a-service }

The Tanssi protocol provides block production as a service, orchestrating a decentralized and trustless set of sequencers, ensuring the networks' liveness. To do so, the protocol bridges both ends:

- **Node operators**: Who run sequencers, offering their block production services to get rewards.
- **Developers**: Who launch networks, which require sequencers.

The protocol assigns a subset of sequencers to provide services to each network, rotating them after a period of time. The sequencers can serve any Tanssi-powered network, regardless of the custom logic they implement. On the other hand, networks deployed through Tanssi can customize their runtime as much as they need to fit their use case and upgrade the logic at any moment in a forkless fashion without worrying about the sequencer's setup.

The following diagram illustrates how Tanssi assigns two sequencers to each active network, selecting them from a decentralized set of sequencers.

```

### Sequencer Selection Process {: #sequencer-selection-process}

At any given time, all Tanssi networks require a certain number of sequencers, depending on the number of active networks and the current block production configuration set in Tanssi. The configuration sets the maximum number of total sequencers in the set and the number of sequencers each network has to have assigned.

=== "Tanssi MainNet"
    |          Variable          |                                       Value                                        |
    |:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |    Max. # of Sequencers    |     {{ networks.mainnet.sequencers.configuration.max_block_producers }}      |
    | # of Sequencers (Networks) | {{ networks.mainnet.sequencers.configuration.block_producer_per_container }} |

=== "Dancelight TestNet"
    |          Variable          |                                       Value                                        |
    |:--------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |    Max. # of Sequencers    |     {{ networks.dancelight.sequencers.configuration.max_block_producers }}      |
    | # of Sequencers (Networks) | {{ networks.dancelight.sequencers.configuration.block_producer_per_container }} |

Once the required number of sequencers for a given session is known, Tanssi uses two mechanisms to decide the set of sequencers distributed among all networks. 

The first mechanism is through the *Invunerables* module, which sets a list of fixed sequencers prioritized by the protocol and ensures block production stability in certain scenarios, such as TestNets. 

The second mechanism is through the [Tanssi staking module](/learn/tanssi/network-features/staking/){target=\_blank}. The module helps create a decentralized set of sequencers for all Tanssi networks by providing the protocol with a sorted list of sequencers by staked amount. Tanssi appends the sorted list by stake of sequencers to the invulnerable ones (if any), then takes from the list only the exact amount of sequencers needed, starting from the top, leaving out of the next session those sequencers that have less staked value, to finally begin the sequencer assignation process.

### Sequencers Assignment {: #block_producers-assignment }

Once the sequencer set that will participate in the next session is known, Tanssi shuffles the list and assigns them to provide block production services to the active Tanssi networks.

The assignment algorithm will start distributing the sequencers serving the networks by the registration date on a first-come, first-served basis. Once the assignment is made, it will be upheld for at least one session, representing a period measured in blocks with a constant set of sequencers. In Tanssi MainNet, the default session duration is set to {{ networks.mainnet.session.blocks }} blocks, which, with an average block time of six seconds, translates to (roughly) {{ networks.mainnet.session.display }} hours.

Every new assignment works intentionally with a one-session delay, so the sequencers know in advance which one of the networks they are assigned to. Sequencers will start syncing the new network they'll have to serve in the next session with a special syncing mechanism called [warp sync](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-sync#sect-sync-warp){target=\_blank}. Warp sync allows the sequencers to swiftly sync the new network without acting as an archive node.

When a new session starts, the Tanssi protocol will put the queued assignment into effect. Sequencers will automatically change and start producing blocks in the new Tanssi network they've been assigned to while discarding the chain state from the previous assignment. Tanssi will also calculate the new assignment, considering changes in Tanssi networks that might have been activated or deactivated and sequencers that might have been added or removed from the pool or changed the total staked value. This new assignment will be queued for the next session.

![Sessions](/images/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/block-production-1.webp)

### The Role of the Tanssi Network {: #tanssi-newtwork }

As previously discussed, the Tanssi protocol assigns sequencers to the Tanssi networks, and the result of this assignment is stored within the chain state.  Besides running the network node, the sequencers also run the Tanssi one. Hence, by accessing the data stored in the finalized blocks of the Tanssi Network, they can learn their assignation for the session, and the Tanssi networks can confirm that a certain group of sequencers have been assigned to them. 

As the Tanssi networks produce blocks, those blocks need to be validated and finalized by an external security provider. Once an operator verifies a block, a small proof of validity is produced and stored in Tanssi, keeping track of the proofs for each block of each chain. This small representation of the proof of validity is called [candidate receipt](https://polkadot.com/blog/the-path-of-a-parachain-block/#candidate-receipts){target=\_blank} and is composed of a set of values, including the state root, which can be used to verify state proofs.

Finally, Tanssi can verify that the author of a network block was the expected one and reward accordingly.

The following diagram shows a simplified model of the data Tanssi stores in its internal state. For every active network (in this example, two), Tanssi stores the assigned sequencers, which are the only ones authorized to produce blocks on the network's behalf, proof of validity (candidate receipts) extended by the security provider's operators, the latest state root, and the latest sequencer. 

![Tanssi's internal state](/images/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/block-production-2.webp)

### The Role of the Tanssi-Powered Network {: #network }

As a sequencer assigned to a Tanssi-powered network includes built-in Tanssi node functionality, it is technically feasible to read the state from the Tanssi Network.

Leveraging this ability to access the states, the current sequencer with the authority to produce a block will read the state of the latest block produced in the Tanssi chain. It will proceed to include this state in the block of the network, the current set of sequencers assigned to the network, and its public signature, allowing Tanssi to know who produced the block and reward the node operator.

Once the block is filled with network transactions, it will be proposed as a candidate and handed over to the Tanssi chain, where the security provider's operators will ensure that the included state proofs match the state proofs from the latest state of Tanssi (preventing unauthorized block production) and that the transactions produced valid state transitions. Having verified the work of the sequencer, the operators will finalize the proposed block, including its candidate receipt in a Tanssi Network block.

![Tanssi-powered network block](/images/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/block-production-3.webp)

## Block Production Fees  {: #block-production-fees }

As presented in the [Introduction](#introduction), Tanssi is an infrastructure protocol that addresses the complexities and high costs associated with setting up and maintaining blockchain infrastructure, streamlining the deployment of networks. This protocol brings benefits for both participants:

- **Networks**: Teams can focus on the core logic of their product, the UX, and the UI without dealing with the challenges of infrastructure bootstrapping and its management.
- **Sequencers**: Bearing with the responsibility of keeping their hardware and software configuration in optimal conditions, they are incentivized to execute transactions and produce blocks on behalf of the Tanssi networks.

[Block production as a service](#block-production-as-a-service) carries associated costs that must be covered by the networks that want to leverage Tanssi for such a purpose. The following sections cover the general aspects of those costs and associated service payments.

### Service Payments {: #service-payments }

There are three main costs associated with block production as a service that any network must cover using Tanssi tokens to deploy successfully and get the block production services:

- **Registration deposit**: The initial deposit that is locked from the account that signs the network registration transaction.
- **Registration storage deposit**: The initial deposit that is locked from the account that signs the network registration transaction. It is a variable amount depending on the appchain's runtime size.
- **Sequencers assignment**: Every time the Tanssi protocol assigns sequencers, which happens once per session, a fixed fee is charged. This fee gives networks the right to be assigned sequencers and discourages networks whose runtime logic fails to produce valid transactions or blocks.
- **Block production**: Networks must pay for each block produced on their behalf. Since the protocol selects and assigns the sequencers on a per-session basis, networks must have enough funds to cover all the blocks to be produced in an entire session to be served.

The current configuration is set as follows:

=== "Tanssi MainNet"
    |           Variable           |                                                                   Value                                                                    |
    |:----------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    |     Registration deposit     |                         {{ networks.mainnet.costs.registration_deposit_fee }} {{ networks.mainnet.token_symbol }}                          |
    | Registration storage deposit | {{ networks.mainnet.costs.registration_deposit_per_byte }} x 10<sup>-5</sup> {{ networks.mainnet.token_symbol }} per appchain runtime byte |
    |    Sequencers assignment     |                      {{ networks.mainnet.costs.cost_per_assignment }} {{ networks.mainnet.token_symbol }} per session                      |
    |       Block production       |                         {{ networks.mainnet.costs.cost_per_block }} {{ networks.mainnet.token_symbol }} per block                          |

=== "Dancelight TestNet"
    |       Variable        |                                                Value                                                |
    |:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
    | Registration deposit  | {{ networks.dancelight.costs.registration_deposit_fee }} {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} |
    | Registration storage deposit  | {{ networks.dancelight.costs.registration_deposit_per_byte }} x 10<sup>-5</sup> {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} per appchain runtime byte |
    | Sequencers assignment |        {{ networks.dancelight.costs.cost_per_assignment }} x 10<sup>-6</sup> {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} per session         |
    |   Block production    |            {{ networks.dancelight.costs.cost_per_block }} x 10<sup>-6</sup> {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} per block            |

To ensure block production in the next session, the total balance must be at least enough to cover the sequencers assignment cost plus the cost to produce the {{ networks.mainnet.session.blocks }} blocks that comprise an entire session.

!!! note
    Although the sequencers assignment and block production costs are currently fixed, as protocol development progresses, they might become dynamic, varying in response to the network's workload.

### Tipping {: #tipping }

On some occasions, Tanssi might experience a high demand for its block production services that can not be met with the available resources. For example, if there are ten active networks for the next session and Tanssi can only serve eight, two networks will stall for the entire session duration.

To deal with these high-workload periods, the Tanssi protocol implements a tipping mechanism that allows networks to compete for a higher priority over the rest. Similar to Ethereum-compatible networks, where a priority fee can be set to outbid competing transactions and obtain preferential execution treatment, the Tanssi networks will be served according to the priority given by the tips they offer. Following the previous example, if there are ten active networks for the next session and Tanssi can only serve eight, then only the eight highest bidding networks will get sequencers assigned.

# What is Tanssi? {: #what-is-tanssi }

Tanssi is a decentralized appchain infrastructure protocol that allows developers to launch their appchain in minutes. In other words, Tanssi reduces the six-to-twelve-month setup process typically required for any team to go live with a new chain to minutes.

You can think of Tanssi as _AWS for appchains_. Instead of dealing with all the networking infrastructure yourself, Tanssi handles all the hurdles, allowing you to focus on building your application logic, growing your community, and other tasks essential to your product's success.

Security is another significant obstacle that developers must deal with, taking on the responsibility of attracting staked assets to ensure consensus security and bootstrapping a validator set, which can be particularly challenging for projects in their early stages. All Tanssi-powered appchains benefit from Ethereum-grade security right from the start, and by leveraging Tanssi's decentralized design, appchains aren't exposed to single points of failure. 

Tanssi-powered appchains also benefit from a modular tech stack, providing ultimate control over the logic that powers the blockchain's runtime, offering an excellent way for projects to scale and build optimized solutions for their products. This complete control over the appchain's logic and governance mechanism suits perfectly a wide range of use cases, including DeFi Protocols, Real World Assets (RWA), Gaming Platforms, and others.

## The Problem with Appchains {: #the-problem-with-appchains }

Developers looking to build decentralized appchains typically have to deal with the following problems:

- **Complex Infrastructure Management**: Appchain deployments typically require handling numerous infrastructural components, including bootstrapping sequencers, operators (also known as validators), wallets, block explorers, oracles, indexers, RPC endpoints, and more. Properly managing these components are both time-consuming and resource-intensive.

- **Weak & Inefficient Security**: Appchains commonly suffer from having a small set of operators or weak economic security. Early-stage projects often lack sufficient economic backing to support a robust consensus mechanism. Moreover, developers often have to pay for full blockchain capacity validation even when they might not have achieved product-market fit, and blocks might be close to empty. This essentially means that operators are being overpaid, and there is a significant opportunity cost, as those resources could be used elsewhere to develop the protocol.

- **Cross-Chain and Interoperability**:  Appchains inherently lack cross-chain capabilities, which prevents them from connecting to other blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, developing interoperability solutions requires specialized expertise and meticulous implementation.

- **Slow Time to Market**: The complexities of appchain infrastructure divert developers' focus from application logic, which is the key driver for intuitive interfaces and a seamless user experience, critical for adoption.

## What Tanssi Provides {: #what-tanssi-provides}

Tanssi addresses the most common appchain pain points by:

- **Sequencing as a Service**: Appchains built with Tanssi have their blocks produced by Tanssi's incentivized workers. Tanssi guarantees the appchain's liveness by orchestrating a decentralized set of sequencers.

- **Economic Security Through External Providers**: Appchains deployed through Tanssi leverage security from a provider of choice (for example, [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} for Ethereum). The protocol is designed to finalize transactions deterministically in seconds through a decentralized set of operators.

- **Tanssi/Ethereum Bridge**: Move liquidity to and from Ethereum using the [built-in bridge](/learn/tanssi/tanssi-ethereum-bridge/){target=\_blank} based on Snowbridge.

- **Key Integrations**: Appchains built with Tanssi can access key infrastructural components alongside block production in a fully automated and standardized way. Tanssi-powered appchains come with built-in support for essential tools, including wallets, block explorers, indexers, RPC providers, and more, saving developers the effort of integrating these components. 

- **Modular Blockchain Framework**: Appchains built with Tanssi can use a modular blockchain framework called [Substrate](https://docs.polkadot.com/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk/){target=\_blank}, which enables developers to quickly and easily build optimized and customizable blockchains for any use case. Tanssi handles most infrastructural complexities, allowing developers to focus on their appchain's custom logic.

In summary, appchains deployed through Tanssi are sovereign Layer 1 solutions designed to be highly modular and interconnected, with a focus on simplifying the deployment process and enabling customization of the appchain itself. This empowers developers to bring their blockchain applications to market faster, securely, and with greater potential for integration and interaction within the broader blockchain ecosystems.

## General Architecture of Tanssi & Tanssi-powered Appchains {: #tanssi-architecture }

As previously discussed, appchains deployed through Tanssi are sovereign and customizable blockchains that, among other features, leverage sequencing as a service and inherit block finality from an external security provider.

A high-level overview of the architecture is presented below, featuring [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank} as the security provider.

![High-level overview of an appchain & Tanssi](/images/learn/tanssi/overview/overview-1.webp)

The Tanssi protocol manages and orchestrates a decentralized set of sequencers assigned to provide block production services to Tanssi-powered appchains. The sequencers execute transactions and include them in blocks, which the security provider's operators then proceed to validate. Symbiotic's restaking protocol allows its operators to offer Ethereum-grade economic security. The mechanism of how this works is explained in two separate articles: [Block Production Services](/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/){target=\_blank} and [Ethereum with Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}.

While the sequencers providing block production services are rotated and reassigned to a different appchain upon every session change, each appchain will have its own set of Data Preservers running full archive nodes, ensuring data availability. These Data Preservers will provide the RPC infrastructure for apps and users interacting with Tanssi-powered appchains.

# Tanssi-Ethereum Bridge {: #tanssi-ethereum-bridge }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Traditional blockchains often create silos, limiting asset and functional interoperability. The Tanssi-Ethereum bridge overcomes these limitations by enabling seamless cross-chain operations that benefit both ecosystems.

The bridge is more than an asset exchange. It’s a secure, standardized protocol for direct cross-chain interaction without centralized intermediaries. Its trustless design avoids the risks of central points of failure that many other bridges face.

This article introduces the Tanssi-Ethereum bridge as a key interoperability layer between the two networks. You’ll learn how it works, including its architecture, operator management, economic model, slashing mechanisms, and asset transfers.

You'll also learn about the consensus layers that secure communication ([BEEFY](https://docs.snowbridge.network/architecture/components#beefyclient){target=\_blank} on [Tanssi](https://docs.tanssi.network/learn/tanssi/){target=\_blank} and the [Ethereum Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/roadmap/beacon-chain/){target=\_blank}), and the roles of provers, verifiers, and relayers, giving you a clear view of how assets and messages move securely between Tanssi and Ethereum.

## Core Functions { : #core-functions }

The bridge facilitates several critical operations between Tanssi and Ethereum:

- **Operator Management** - maintains operator stake information on Ethereum via the [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/#tanssi-symbiotic){target=\_blank} protocol, providing this data to Tanssi for selecting active, decentralized, and economically aligned operators each era
- **Economic Operations** - distributes [rewards](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/#rewards){target=\_blank} from Tanssi to Ethereum stakers and operators
- **Slashing** - processes [slashing requests](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/#slashing){target=\_blank} from Tanssi to Ethereum when operators violate protocol rules
- **Asset Transfer** - enables bilateral, trustless asset transfers between Tanssi and Ethereum, enhancing liquidity.

This interoperability expands the potential of decentralized applications and significantly enhances the liquidity and usability of blockchain assets.

## The Bridge Architecture { : #bridge-architecture }

Understanding the bridge's consensus functionality requires examining its core components: provers, verifiers, and relayers. Provers generate cryptographic proofs, verifiers validate them, and relayers move data between chains.

Provers include Tanssi's [BEEFY](https://docs.snowbridge.network/architecture/components#beefyclient){target=\_blank} module and Ethereum's Beacon Chain consensus. They produce consensus data transmitted by specialized relayers.

Each chain runs a [light client](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/light-clients/){target=\_blank} of the other, acting as an on-chain verifier for data legitimacy. For instance, when Tanssi sends a message to Ethereum, it generates compact proofs of events or state changes based on its consensus. Ethereum's light client verifies these proofs before acting. This efficient method avoids processing the entire sending chain's state, relying instead on concise cryptographic proof verification.

### Tanssi to Ethereum Consensus  { : #tanssi-ethereum-consensus }

BEEFY (Bridge Efficiency Enabling Finality Yielder) is Tanssi's consensus protocol, which acts as a prover. It's designed for efficient, trustless bridging to chains like Ethereum that are not natively built for interoperability.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant Tanssi_Pallet as Tanssi <br/> BEEFY Pallet (prover)
    participant Beefy_Relayer as Relayer <br/> (Beefy)
    participant Eth_BeefyClient as Ethereum <br/> BEEFY Client (verifier)

    Tanssi_Pallet->>Beefy_Relayer: Generate BEEFY Commitment
    activate Beefy_Relayer
    Beefy_Relayer->>Eth_BeefyClient: Submit commitment/proof
    deactivate Beefy_Relayer

    activate Eth_BeefyClient
    Eth_BeefyClient->>Eth_BeefyClient: Verify commitment
    deactivate Eth_BeefyClient

```

### Ethereum to Tanssi Consensus { : #ethereum-tanssi-consensus }

For Ethereum-to-Tanssi bridging, Ethereum's Beacon Chain consensus is the prover. It provides Tanssi's on-chain light client with proof of Ethereum's finalized state, including events or messages for Tanssi.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant Eth_BeaconCons as Ethereum <br/> Beacon Chain Consensus(Prover)
    participant Beacon_Relayer as Relayer <br/> (Beacon)
    participant Tanssi_EthClient as Tanssi <br/> Ethereum Light Client (verifier)

    Eth_BeaconCons->>Beacon_Relayer: Beacon chain update (Header/Proof)
    activate Beacon_Relayer
    Beacon_Relayer->>Tanssi_EthClient: Submit update/proof
    deactivate Beacon_Relayer

    activate Tanssi_EthClient
    Tanssi_EthClient->>Tanssi_EthClient: Verify update/proof
    deactivate Tanssi_EthClient
```

From a messaging perspective, the bridge uses its consensus verification layer for secure cross-chain communication. Dedicated relayers transport messages: the Execution Relay for Ethereum to Tanssi, and the Tanssi Relay for Tanssi to Ethereum.

Relayers are stateless and only submit proofs. They cannot forge messages or steal funds, as the consensus mechanism revalidates each proof on-chain. Multiple concurrent relayers improve responsiveness without centralizing power.

Ethereum's `Gateway` contract is the central messaging point. It receives messages from Tanssi via relayers, validates them using consensus proofs, and executes operations like token minting/unlocking or smart contract calls.

### Ethereum to Tanssi Inbound Messages { : #ethereum-tanssi-messages }

This section describes messages from Ethereum to Tanssi, using Ethereum's Beacon Chain consensus for proofs and an Execution Relay (or Beacon Relay).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant Eth_Gateway as Ethereum <br/> Gateway Contract
    participant Exec_Relay as Relayer <br/> (Execution Relay)
    participant Tanssi_InQueue as Tanssi <br/> Inbound Queue

    Note over Eth_Gateway: Message Ready / Event Occurs
    Eth_Gateway->>Exec_Relay: Message + Proof
    activate Exec_Relay
    Exec_Relay->>Tanssi_InQueue: Submit Message/Proof
    deactivate Exec_Relay

    activate Tanssi_InQueue
    Tanssi_InQueue->>Tanssi_InQueue: Process Inbound Message
    deactivate Tanssi_InQueue
```

### Tanssi to Ethereum Outbound Messages { : #tanssi-ethereum-messages }

This section describes messages from Tanssi to Ethereum, using BEEFY consensus to prove Tanssi's state and a Tanssi Relay for transmission.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant Tanssi_OutQueue as Tanssi <br/> Outbound Queue
    participant Para_Relay as Relayer <br/> (Tanssi Relay)
    participant Eth_Gateway as Ethereum <br/> Gateway Contract

    Note over Tanssi_OutQueue: Message Ready / Proof Committed
    Tanssi_OutQueue->>Para_Relay: Message + Proof
    activate Para_Relay
    Para_Relay->>Eth_Gateway: Submit Message/Proof
    deactivate Para_Relay

    activate Eth_Gateway
    Eth_Gateway->>Eth_Gateway: Process Outbound Message
    deactivate Eth_Gateway
```

The `Gateway` manages Ethereum's outbound communications. For cross-chain transfers, it logs an event, locks tokens if necessary, and packages data for relay to Tanssi. Tanssi uses two queues for efficient message processing.

The `Outbound Queue` handles messages to Ethereum. It bundles them and adds a [Merkle root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree){target=\_blank} (cryptographic commitment) to each block header. This allows Ethereum's light client to verify message inclusion using consensus proofs efficiently.

The `Inbound Queue` processes messages from Ethereum. It receives and verifies proofs of Ethereum events via Tanssi's on-chain Ethereum light client. Verified events become internal instructions in Tanssi. This layered, consensus-secured architecture ensures trustless cross-chain interactions.

## Token Transfers Flow {: #token-transfers-flow }

This section explains how the bridge moves assets and messages. It involves locking/minting assets on one chain and a complementary action on the other, secured by verified proofs. The following describes the typical transfer sequences.

1. **Initiation (Source Chain)** - user initiates asset transfer
2. **Relay Proof** - off-chain relayers pick up the event and submit cryptographic proofs to the destination chain
3. **Verification (Destination Chain)** - on-chain light clients independently verify submitted proofs
4. **Execution** - upon successful verification, tokens are minted/unlocked on the destination chain

### Ethereum to Tanssi Transfer

This section outlines asset movement from Ethereum to Tanssi (as derivative assets).

1. **Lock on Ethereum** - a user deposits assets into Ethereum's Bridge contract. The contract locks the tokens and emits a deposit event
2. **Relay Proof to Tanssi** - an off-chain relayer detects the finalized event, creates a proof package (including Ethereum block header and Merkle proof of the deposit), and submits it to the Tanssi Bridge's `Inbound Queue`
3. **Verify on Tanssi** - Tanssi Bridge's `EthereumClient` module (an on-chain light client) receives the proof from the `Inbound Queue`. It verifies the Ethereum block header's finality/validity and the Merkle proof's authenticity
4. **Mint on Tanssi** - upon successful verification by the `EthereumClient`, the `Inbound Queue` is notified and mints the corresponding asset on Tanssi

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant User
    participant EBridge as Ethereum Bridge Contract
    participant Relayer
    participant TBP as Tanssi Bridge<br/> (Inbound Queue + ETH Client)
    participant TAH as Tanssi

    User->>EBridge: 1. Deposit Asset
    activate EBridge
    Note over EBridge: Lock Tokens & Emit Event
    deactivate EBridge

    Relayer->>Relayer: Observe Ethereum Event
    Relayer->>TBP: 2. Submit Header + Merkle Proof
    activate TBP
    Note over TBP: Receive Proof (Inbound Queue)
    TBP->>TBP: 3. Verify Proof (EthereumClient Pallet)
    TBP->>TAH: Send Mint Request
    deactivate TBP

    activate TAH
    TAH->>TAH:  4. Mint Asset
    TAH-->>User: (Asset appears in Recipient Account)
    deactivate TAH
```

### Tanssi to Ethereum Transfer

This flow describes the reverse process, moving assets from Tanssi to Ethereum.

1. **Initiate and Commit on Tanssi** - user initiates a transfer on Tanssi. A message with transfer details goes to the Bridge's `Outbound Queue`. The queue processes it, bundles the payload, and commits its Merkle root to the Tanssi block header, representing all outgoing messages in that block
2. **Relay Proof to Ethereum** - an off-chain relayer monitors Tanssi for finalized blocks with `Outbound Queue` Merkle roots. It retrieves proofs: a BEEFY commitment (signed statement of finalized Tanssi block headers) and a Merkle proof of the user's transfer payload under the committed root
3. **Submit Commitment in Ethereum** - the relayer submits the BEEFY commitment and Merkle proof to Ethereum's `Gateway` contract
4. **Verify on Ethereum** - Ethereum's Beefy Client contract (Tanssi's on-chain light client) receives the BEEFY commitment from the `Gateway` and verifies its validity (including signatures)
5. **Validate Payload** - after commitment verification, the `Gateway` validates the Merkle proof for the user's payload
6. **Execute on Ethereum** - with both proofs verified, the `Gateway` contract executes the action, usually releasing locked assets via the main Bridge contract to the recipient or executing a target contract call on Ethereum

The following diagram illustrates the initiation and commitment phase of the asset transfer process on the Tanssi side.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %%{init: {'sequence': {'mirrorActors': false}}}%%
    participant User
    participant TAH as Tanssi
    participant TBP as Tanssi Bridge<br/> (Outbound Queue)
    participant Relayer

    User->>TAH: 1. Initiate Transfer & Deposit Asset
    activate TAH
    TAH->>TBP: Send message to Outbound Queue
    deactivate TAH

    activate TBP
    Note over TBP: Process message, Bundle, and<br/>Commit Merkle Root to Tanssi Header
    deactivate TBP

    Relayer->>Relayer: 2. Observe Tanssi Header /<br/>BEEFY Commitment & Get Proof
    Note over Relayer: Relayer is now ready to interact<br/>with Ethereum based on observed data.
```

The subsequent diagram details the relay, verification, and execution steps on the Ethereum side of the asset transfer.

# Set Up an On-Chain Identity

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The [Substrate](/learn/framework/overview/#substrate-framework){target=\_blank} Identity [module](/learn/framework/modules/){target=\_blank} is an out-of-the-box solution for adding personal information to your on-chain account. Establishing an identity makes it easier for your account to be recognized by others, as your display name will automatically populate when someone pastes your address into a field on the [developer portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.mainnet.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank}.

The identity you configure goes beyond a simple display name. Personal information can include default fields such as your legal name, display name, website, Twitter handle, Discord, and Riot (now known as Element) name. You can also use custom fields to include any other relevant information.

This guide will demonstrate setting up an identity with a display name and additional parameters, enhancing your visibility and recognizability.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

To store your information on-chain, you must bond some funds, which will eventually be returned once the identity has been cleared. There are two categories of fields: default and custom. A basic deposit amount is reserved upon identity creation, and a storage deposit is required for each additional byte of data stored on-chain.

- **Default fields include** - your legal name, display name, website, Twitter handle, Discord, Riot (now known as Element) name

- **Custom fields include** - any other relevant information

- **Subaccounts** - You can link subaccounts underneath a primary account. As an example, a sequencer service that's running multiple different sequencer nodes can establish subaccounts to demonstrate an official link between the nodes

To follow along with this guide, you will need the following:

=== "Tanssi MainNet"

    - The [developer portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.mainnet.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank} open and connected to Tanssi MainNet.
    - At least one account funded with `{{ networks.mainnet.token_symbol }}` tokens.

=== "Dancelight TestNet"
    
    - The [developer portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank} open and connected to [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}.
    - At least one account funded with `{{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }}` tokens.

If you need help importing your accounts into the developer portal, please check out the [Connecting to the developer portal](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/talisman/#connecting-to-polkadotjs){target=\_blank} guide.

## Get Started {: #get-started }

Depending on the information to be included, there are a couple of different ways to set and clear an identity using the developer portal. If you intend to register your identity using only the default fields, you can follow the instructions for [Managing an Identity via the Accounts](#manage-via-accounts) page. **This is the recommended way to set and manage your identity**.

If you want to add custom fields beyond the default fields, follow the instructions for [Managing an Identity via the Extrinsics](#manage-via-extrinsics) page.

!!! note
    Please note that using the **Accounts** page on the developer portal is recommended to manage your identity as it provides an easy-to-use interface that enforces character limits. If you use the **Extrinsics** page, please be aware that your input for each field (i.e., name, email, etc.) must be 32 characters or less; otherwise, your information will be cut off.

## Manage an Identity via Accounts {: #manage-via-accounts }

### Set an Identity {: #set-identity-accounts }

To get started with setting an identity using the Accounts page, head to the [**Accounts** tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.mainnet.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank} of the developer portal.

You should already have an account connected, so you can click on your account name to verify and note your balances. After you send the transaction to set an identity, the deposit(s) you submitted will be moved from your transferable balance to your reserved balance.

![Starting account balances](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-1.webp)

To set your identity, you'll need to:

1. Click on the three vertical dots next to the account you would like to set an identity for
2. A menu will pop up. Click **Set on-chain identity**

![Set on-chain identity](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-2.webp)

Next, the menu to register and set your identity will pop up, and you can start filling in your information. You are not required to enter information for every single field; you can choose to fill in just one field or all of them; it's up to you. For this example:

1. Set your display name
2. Click on the **include field** toggle for email and then enter in your email
3. Click on the **include field** toggle for web and then enter in your website URL
4. Click on the **include field** toggle for Twitter and then enter in your Twitter handle
5. Review the prior data fields and click **Set Identity**

![Set your identity](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-3.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. If everything looks good, sign it.

You should see status notifications pop up in the top right-hand corner. Once the transaction has been confirmed, you can click on your account name again, and the panel will slide out on the right side of the page. Your balances will have changed, and you'll also see your new identity information.

![Updated account balances](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-4.webp)

If the identity information matches what you entered, you've successfully set an identity!

Once you clear your identity, the deposit in your reserved balance will get transferred back to your transferable balance. If you need to change your identity, you can go through the process of setting your identity again. Please note that you must ensure all fields are re-entered, even if only one field needs to be changed, or they will be overwritten. You will not need to pay another deposit unless custom fields are used, but you will need to pay gas fees.

## Manage an Identity via Extrinsics {: #manage-via-extrinsics }

### Set an Identity {: #set-identity-extrinsics }

To register an identity using the extrinsics page, navigate to the [**Extrinsics** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.mainnet.dns_name }}#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} of the developer portal. Please ensure your input does not exceed 32 characters for each identity field. To complete your identity, take the following steps:

1. Select your account
2. Select identity from the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown
3. Then select the **setIdentity(info)** function
4. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter your **Display Name**
5. Enter the data for **Display** in the selected format
6. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter your web address
7. Enter your website URL in the selected format
8. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter your email
9. Enter your email address in the selected format
10. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter your Twitter handle
11. Enter your Twitter in the selected format. Enter the username only, starting with the `@` symbol
12. Review the prepared fields and press **Submit Transaction**

![Set on-chain identity](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-5.webp)

Optionally, if you would like to enter custom fields, take the following steps:

1. Scroll to the top and click on **Add item**
2. Two fields will appear: the first for the field name and the second for the value. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter the field name
3. Enter the field name in the specified format
4. Select **Raw** as the data format to enter the custom value
5. Enter the custom value in the specified format

![Add custom fields](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-6.webp)

Finally, once all of your identity information has been added, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Submit Transaction**.

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. Remember, an additional deposit is required for each additional custom field. If everything looks good, sign the transaction.

You should see status notifications pop up in the top right-hand corner confirming the transaction. If successful, you've set an identity! Congratulations! To ensure everything went through and your identity information looks good, you can verify your identity.

### Confirm an Identity {: #confirm-identity-extrinsics }

To verify the addition of your identity information, you can click on the **Developer** tab and then navigate to [**Chain state**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.mainnet.dns_name }}#/chainstate){target=\_blank}.

On the **Chain State** page, make sure **Storage** is selected. Then you can start to request your identity information:

1. Set **selected state query** to **identity**
2. Select the **identityOf(AccountId)** function
3. Select your account
4. Click the **+** button to get your identity information

![Request identity information](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-7.webp)

You can see now that you've successfully set an identity! Once you clear your identity, the deposit in your reserved balance will get transferred back to your transferable balance. If you need to change your identity, you can go through the process of setting your identity again. Please note that you must ensure all fields are re-entered, even if only one field needs to be changed, or they will be overwritten. You will not need to pay another deposit unless custom fields are used, but you will need to pay gas fees.

## Clear an Identity {: #confirm-identity-extrinsics }

To clear your identity, take the following steps from **Extrinsics** tab of the developer portal:

1. Select your account from the **using the selected account** dropdown
2. Select **identity** from the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown
3. Then select the **clearIdentity()** function
4. Click **Submit Transaction**

![Clear an identity](/images/builders/account-management/identity/identity-8.webp)

You will then be prompted to sign the transaction. If everything looks good, sign it. You should see status notifications in the top right-hand corner confirming the transaction.

To confirm that your identity information has been successfully removed, revisit the steps outlined in the [Confirm an Identity section](#confirm-identity-extrinsics). This time, instead of displaying your identity details, the response should indicate **none**, confirming that no identity information is currently linked to your account. Additionally, when you check your balances, you will find that the deposit initially made for setting your identity has been credited back to your transferable balance. This completes the process of clearing your identity.

# Proxy Accounts

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Proxy accounts can be set up to perform a limited number of actions on behalf of primary accounts and are helpful for keeping the underlying accounts safe. Your proxy account can act as a "hot wallet" to interact with the network on behalf of your "cold wallet" account. For added safety, you can regularly rotate the proxy account. 

Proxy accounts can also help you implement the principle of least privilege for access control. For example, if you have multiple team members, you can give them the minimum level of access required to carry out their duties via a specific type of proxy account. 

This tutorial will walk you through configuring a proxy account on Dancelight, the Tanssi TestNet, specifically for balance transfers. Then, it will demonstrate performing a balance transfer using the newly created proxy.

## Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have:

- [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank} open and connected to [Dancelight](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}.
- Create or have two accounts accessible on the developer portal.
- At least one of the accounts will need to be funded with `{{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }}` tokens.

If you need help importing your accounts into Polkadot.js Apps, please check out the [Connecting to Polkadot.js](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/talisman/#connecting-to-polkadotjs){target=\_blank} guide.

## General Definitions {: #general-definitions }

When setting up a proxy account, a bond for the proxy is taken out of your free balance and moved to your reserved balance. The bond is required as adding a proxy requires on-chain storage space, and it is recalculated for each proxy you add or remove. The bond is returned to your free balance after all proxies are removed from your account.

The deposit is calculated based on a deposit base and a deposit factor:

- **Deposit base** - the amount to be reserved for an account to have a proxy list.
- **Deposit factor** - the additional amount to be reserved for every proxy the primary account has.

The equation for calculating the deposit is:

```text
deposit base + deposit factor * number of proxies
```

## Proxy Types {: #proxy-types }

When creating a proxy account, you must choose a type of proxy that will define how the proxy can be used. The available options are:

- **`Any`** - allows the proxy account to use any function supported by the proxy pallet. There is no filtering of calls.
- **`NonTransfer`** - this type of proxy account is allowed to submit any type of transaction with the exception of balance transfers.
- **`Balances`** - allows the proxy account to only make transactions related to sending funds.
- **`Governance`** - allows the proxy account to only make transactions related to the governance pallet, such as voting or creating democracy proposals. Note, governance is not yet enabled on Tanssi. You can create governance proxy accounts but they will not be able to take any actions until governance is enabled. 
- **`Registrar`** - allows the proxy account to only make transactions related to the registrar pallet.
- **`SudoRegistrar`** - allows the proxy account to only make transactions related to the registrar pallet that need to be called by Sudo.
- **`CancelProxy`** - allows the proxy account to reject and remove any announced proxy calls.
- **`Staking`** - allows the proxy account to perform staking-related transactions, such as sequencer and `session()` functions.
- **`SessionKeyManagement`** - allows the proxy account to make key management related transactions included in the session pallet.

For this guide, you will be setting up a proxy account using the balances proxy type. Since this type enables the proxy to spend funds on behalf of the primary account, you should exercise caution and only provide access to accounts you trust. The proxy will have access to transfer all of the funds within the primary account, and if not trusted, the proxy could drain the primary account. Ensure that you maintain oversight of your proxy accounts and remove any proxies that are no longer needed.

## Creating a Proxy Account {: #creating-a-proxy-account }

There are a couple of ways you can create proxy accounts in [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/accounts){target=\_blank}, either from the **Extrinsics** page or the **Accounts** page. However, to create a time-delayed proxy, you will need to use the **Extrinsics** page. A time delay provides an additional layer of security to proxies by specifying a delay period based on the number of blocks. This will prevent the proxy account from executing a transaction until the delay period ends. The delay allows time for the primary account that controls the proxy to review pending transactions, potentially for malicious actions, and cancel if necessary before execution.

The following demo will showcase configuring a Balances proxy, which allows for transferring funds, making it perfect for demonstration purposes. After configuring your Balances proxy you can try transferring funds from the primary account via proxy. 

To get started creating your proxy account, head to the **Developer** tab and select [**Extrinsics**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} from the dropdown. Next, you will need to take the following steps:

1. Select the primary account.
2. From the **submit the following extrinsic** dropdown, select **proxy**.
3. Choose the **addProxy** extrinsic.
4. Choose **Id** from the **AccountIdLookupOf** dropdown.
5. Select the **delegate** account for the proxy.
6. From the **proxyType** dropdown, choose **Balances**.
7. Optionally, you can add a time delay using a specified number of blocks to add an additional layer of security for the primary account to review the pending transaction.
8. Click **Submit Transaction**.

![Add a proxy account from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-1.webp)

You will then be prompted to authorize and sign the transaction. Click **Sign and Submit** to create the proxy relationship. Once the transaction has been successfully submitted, you will receive some notifications confirming the transaction.

As previously mentioned, you can also create a proxy from the **Accounts** page. To do so, navigate to the **Accounts** page and take the following steps:

1. Select the three vertical dots next to the primary account.
2. Select **Add proxy**.

![Select the Add proxy menu item from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-2.webp)

!!! note
    If the account already has a proxy, **Manage proxies** will be displayed as an option instead of **Add proxy**.

A pop-up will appear and you can enter in the required information, such as the proxied/primary account, the proxy account, and type of proxy to create a proxy account. First click **Add Proxy**.

![Add a proxy account from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-3.webp)

Then, take the following steps:

1. Select the account you would like to set as a proxy.
2. Select the proxy type.
3. Click **Submit** and sign the transaction.

![Add the details of the proxy account, including the proxy account and type.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-4.webp)

In the next section, you will learn how to verify that your proxy account was set up successfully.

## Verifying Your Proxy Account {: #verifying-your-proxy-account }

You can verify that your proxy account has been successfully set up in a couple of ways: either through the **Accounts** page or via the **Chain state** page.

To check your proxy accounts from the [**Chain state** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/chainstate){target=\_blank}, you can take the following steps:

1. From the **selected state query** dropdown, select **proxy**.
2. Choose the **proxies** extrinsic.
3. Select your primary/proxied account.
4. Click on the **+** button to send the query.

![Verify your proxy accounts via the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-5.webp)

The result will appear on the page showing you information about all of your proxies, including the delegate/proxy account address, the proxy type, the delay period if one was specified, and the total bond amount for all of your proxies in Planck.

You can also check your proxy accounts from the **Accounts** page. To do so, navigate to the **Accounts** page, and there should be a Proxy symbol next to the primary account. Hover over the icon and click on **Manage proxies** to review your proxies.

![Hover over the proxy icon to manage your proxies via the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-6.webp)

A pop-up will appear where you can see an overview of all of your proxy accounts.

![Review your proxy accounts.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-7.webp)

## Executing a Proxy Transaction {: #executing-a-proxy-transaction }

Now that you have created a proxy account and verified that it was successfully set up, you can execute a transaction using the proxy account on behalf of the primary account.

To execute a transaction, you can navigate back to the [**Extrinsics** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/extrinsics){target=\_blank} and take the following steps:

1. Select the proxy account to submit the transaction from the **using the select account** dropdown.
2. From the **submit the following extrinsic** menu, select **proxy**.
3. Choose the **proxy** extrinsic.
4. Choose **Id** from the **AccountIdLookupOf** dropdown.
5. Select the primary account from the **real** dropdown.
6. Select the **balances** call.
7. Choose the **transferKeepAlive** extrinsic.
8. Choose **Id** from the **AccountIdLookupOf** dropdown.
9. In the **dest** field, enter the address you would like to send funds to.
10. In the **value** field, enter the amount of {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} tokens to send. For this example, you can send `2` {{ networks.dancelight.token_symbol }} tokens.
11. Click **Submit Transaction**.

![Execute a proxy transaction from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-8.webp)

A pop-up will appear for you to authorize and sign the transaction. Enter your password for the proxy account and click **Sign and Submit**.

If the transaction successfully went through, you should see a couple of notification pop-ups. If you head over to the **Accounts** page, you'll see that your primary account balance has decreased. If you check the account balance where you sent the funds, you'll notice the balance there has increased.

![Check balance on the accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-9.webp)

That's it! You've successfully executed a transaction using a proxy account on behalf of your primary account.

## Removing a Proxy Account {: #removing-a-proxy-account }

Similarly to adding a proxy account, there are a couple of ways that you can remove a proxy account, either from the **Extrinsics** page or the **Accounts** page. Regardless of which page you use, you can elect to remove a single proxy account or all proxies associated with your primary account.

To remove a proxy from the [**Extrinsics** page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://{{ networks.dancelight.dns_name }}#/extrinsics){target=\_blank}, you can take the following steps:

1. From the **using the selected account** dropdown, select your primary account.
2. Then select **proxy**.
3. Choose **removeProxy** to remove a single proxy or **removeProxies** to remove all associated proxies.
4. Choose **Id** from the **AccountIdLookupOf** dropdown.
5. If removing a single proxy, enter the proxy account to remove in the **delegate** field.
6. Select the **proxyType** to remove, in this case choose **Balances**.
7. Optionally, select a delay period in block numbers.
8. Click **Submit Transaction**.

![Remove a proxy account from the Extrinsics page of Polkadot.js Apps](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-10.webp)

A pop-up will appear asking you to authorize and sign the transaction. You can sign and send the transaction from the primary or proxy account, but the call to remove the proxy must be sent from the primary account. Enter your password and click **Sign and Submit**.

To check that the proxy or proxy accounts have been removed, follow the steps in the [Verifying your Proxy Account](#verifying-your-proxy-account) section.

As previously mentioned, you can also remove a proxy from the **Accounts** page. To do so, on the **Accounts** page, select the three vertical dots next to the primary account and select **Manage Proxies**.

![Click on the Manage Proxies button to review and manage your proxy accounts.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-11.webp)

A pop-up will appear showing an overview of your proxy accounts. To remove all proxies, you can click on **Clear all**, then you will automatically be prompted to enter your password and submit the transaction. To remove a single proxy, take the following steps:

1. Click the **X** button next to the proxy to remove
2. Press **Submit**

![Remove a proxy account from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps.](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-12.webp)

On the transaction confirmation screen, take the following steps:

1. Ensure that you do not use a proxy for this call (as this example is a balances proxy, the call to remove the proxy needs to come from the primary account rather than the proxy account).
2. Enter your password for the respective account.
3. Press **Sign and Submit**.

![Remove a proxy account from the Accounts page of Polkadot.js Apps, confirmation](/images/builders/account-management/proxy/proxy-13.webp)

Once the transaction has successfully been submitted, you can review your current proxies, or if you removed all proxies, you will notice the proxy icon is no longer being displayed next to the primary account. And that's it! You've successfully created a proxy, reviewed all proxy accounts associated with your primary account, executed a proxy transaction, and removed a proxy account!

# Templates Overview {: #templates-overview }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Networks deployed through Tanssi are fully customizable blockchains benefiting from a shared set of sequencers and the security of a provider of their choice. The templates presented in this article implement the necessary functionalities and configurations to support the Tanssi protocol, making development easier.

## Base Setup to Support the Tanssi Protocol {: #base-setup-supporting-tanssi }

Tanssi networks must implement the following modules to support the protocol and benefit safely from Tanssi's block production as a service:

- **Author Noting** - registers the set of sequencers assigned to the network by Tanssi
- **Author Inherent** - allows the sequencer authoring the block to include its identity to get validated and rewarded

If you don't include these modules in the Tanssi network's runtime, there won't be a method to confirm that the blocks are being generated by trustworthy sequencers designated by the Tanssi orchestrator. This could create a vulnerability for malicious actors to exploit and compromise the network. For more information about Tanssi's block production as a service please refer to the [Block Production Services](/learn/tanssi/network-services/block-production/){target=\_blank} article.

Besides block production, there are other essential aspects for any network covered in the templates, such as:

- **Consensus** - networks have the necessary functionality to allow the sequencers to produce blocks, gossip and validate them, and coordinate with the security provider to get notified about the block's finality
- **Networks Interoperability** - handles the ingestion and dispatch of incoming downward and lateral messages, allowing a Tanssi network to communicate and interoperate with the other chains within the ecosystem
- **Runtime Upgrades** - a runtime upgrade in a Tanssi network must be informed to the security provider's operators to allow them to check on the blocks produced by the sequencers of the Tanssi networks

## Included Modules {: #included-modules }

Besides the necessary modules to support the operation of a Tanssi network, many other modules provide functional behavior that the users can interact with.

These are some of the functional modules exposing a behavior to the users that are included in the templates and ready to use:

- **[Balances](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_balances/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Balances module provides functions for handling accounts and balances for the Tanssi network native currency
- **[Utility](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_utility/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Utility module provides functions to execute multiple calls in a single dispatch. Besides batching transactions, this module also allows the execution of a call from an alternative signed origin
- **[Proxy](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_proxy/index.html){target=\_blank}** - the Proxy module provides functions to delegate to other accounts (proxies) the permission to dispatch calls from a proxied origin
- **[Maintenance Mode](https://github.com/moondance-labs/moonkit/blob/tanssi-polkadot-v1.3.0/pallets/maintenance-mode/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Maintenance Mode module allows the Tanssi network to be set to a mode where it doesn't execute balance/asset transfers or other transactions. This could be useful when upgrading the runtime in an emergency, when executing large storage migrations, or when a security vulnerability is discovered
- **[Tx Pause](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/tx-pause/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Tx Pause module allows a valid origin (typically Root) to pause (and unpause) an entire module or a single transaction. A paused transaction (or all the transactions included in a paused module) will fail when called until it is unpaused. This module provides a higher degree of granularity compared to maintenance mode, making it particularly useful when a faulty or vulnerable transaction is identified in the runtime
- **[Multisig](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/multisig/src/lib.rs){target=\_blank}** - the Multisig module enables transaction dispatches that require -typically- more than one signature. A multisig transaction defines a set of authorized accounts and a threshold for its approval, requiring consensus among multiple parties

## Start Building {: #getting-started }

To start building on top of the provided templates, be it the [baseline Tanssi network template](/builders/build/templates/substrate/){target=\_blank} or the [baseline EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) template](/builders/build/templates/evm/){target=\_blank}, the recommended approach is to fork the [Tanssi repository](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi){target=\_blank} and start adding [built-in modules](/builders/build/customize/adding-built-in-module/){target=\_blank} or [custom-made modules](/builders/build/customize/adding-custom-made-module/){target=\_blank} on top of the [latest release](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/releases/latest){target=\_blank} tag.

This approach comes with some advantages, such as:

- Building on top of the latest and stable release
- Get the Tanssi protocol already configured and included in the template runtime
- Keep your fork up-to-date by syncing with the Tanssi upstream repository
- Run the included tests, ensuring that block production on your Tanssi network works as intended
- Run a complete local environment with the included [Zombienet](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet){target=\_blank} configuration

If the templates already cover your use case needs, or after building and testing your chain, you can continue with the [Deploy Your Network via the Tanssi DApp](/builders/deploy/dapp/){target=\_blank} article to know how to use the Tanssi dApp to register and get your chain up and running.

# Using the Built-In Tanssi Bridge

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Tanssi protocol orchestrates infrastructure components, allowing developers to launch their customized appchains in minutes and providing them with out-of-the-box Ethereum-grade economic security. To make the whole process easy for developers, a [top-of-class architecture](/learn/tanssi/overview/#tanssi-architecture){target=\_blank} was designed and implemented.

The [TANSSI token](/builders/tanssi-network/tanssi-token/){target=\_blank} is the engine that enables the integration of different infrastructural components with [external security providers](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank} and aligns incentives across various actors, including token holders, node operators, and appchain builders. To serve different use cases, the token has two versions: the Tanssi network's native currency, TANSSI (Substrate), and its ERC-20 version, on Ethereum.

Users can convert from one version to the other of the token using a [Tanssi built-in trustless bridge](/learn/tanssi/tanssi-ethereum-bridge/){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, you'll learn how to move your assets from Tanssi to Ethereum and vice versa through a secure and user-friendly web interface available at the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network/bridge){target=\_blank}, making cross-chain transfers accessible for everyone.

## Prerequisites {: #prerequisites }

Before using the Tanssi bridge, ensure you have:

For bridging from Tanssi to Ethereum:

- A [Substrate-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/){target=\_blank}, such as [Talisman](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/talisman/){target=\_blank}.
- TANSSI (Substrate) balance to transfer and pay the bridging fees.
- The Ethereum-type destination account.

For bridging from Ethereum to Tanssi:

- An [Ethereum-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/){target=\_blank}, such as [MetaMask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.
- TANSSI (ERC-20) balance to transfer.
- ETH balance to pay the bridging fees.
- The Substrate-type destination account.

## Bridging TANSSI Tokens to Ethereum {: #bridge-to-ethereum }

If you want to convert your TANSSI (Substrate) tokens to TANSSI (ERC-20) on Ethereum, head to the Tanssi dApp, open the [bridge section](https://apps.tanssi.network/bridge){target=\_blank}, and then follow these steps:

1. Select **Mainnet** from the **From** dropdown.
2. Click on **Connect Wallet**. A pop-up will appear, allowing you to select your preferred Substrate wallet and choose the corresponding account.

![Select Tanssi Network and Connect the Wallet](/images/builders/interoperability/built-in-bridge/built-in-bridge-1.webp)

Now, with your wallet connected:

1. Select the destination account from the **Select recipient address** dropdown, or choose the **Enter a custom address** item and enter the account where you want to receive the ERC-20 tokens manually.
2. Enter the amount to bridge in the **Balance** field. The estimated bridge and transaction fees will be displayed along with the amount the destination account will receive.
3. Click on **Send** and sign the transaction.

![Execute the Transaction](/images/builders/interoperability/built-in-bridge/built-in-bridge-2.webp)

And that's it! Your tokens will be bridged when the next session starts. You can see how much time remains in the current session in the progress bar.

!!! note
    - You can easily add the TANSSI ERC-20 contract address to your wallet by clicking the **+** icon shown next to your balance.
    - Fees to convert your TANSSI (Substrate) tokens to TANSSI (ERC-20) might fluctuate over time and must be paid using TANSSI.

## Bridging ERC-20 TANSSI to Tanssi Network {: #bridge-to-tanssi }

If you want to convert your TANSSI (ERC-20) tokens to TANSSI (Substrate) native on the Tanssi network, head to the Tanssi dApp, open the [bridge section](https://apps.tanssi.network/bridge){target=\_blank}, and then follow these steps:

1. Select **Ethereum** from the **From** dropdown.
2. Click on **Connect Wallet**, select your preferred Ethereum wallet, and choose the account.

![Select Ethereum and Connect the Wallet](/images/builders/interoperability/built-in-bridge/built-in-bridge-3.webp)

# TANSSI Token {: #tanssi-token }

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Tanssi network token is the utility token that powers the Tanssi protocol. Considering [Tanssi's architecture](/learn/tanssi/overview/#tanssi-architecture){target=\_blank}, the token exists in two distinct yet interconnected representations: native substrate and Ethereum ERC-20. The two versions can be bridged between each other through the [Tanssi-Ethereum bridge](/learn/tanssi/tanssi-ethereum-bridge/){target=\_blank}.

In this guide, the token's utility and the differences between its two representations are covered, which is crucial for network operators, stakers, appchain managers, and general users who want to participate in the Tanssi ecosystem.

## Token Utility {: #token-utility }

Tanssi is a decentralized infrastructure protocol that makes deploying appchains with custom logic easy. It allows developers to focus on the use case instead of diverting time and energy to manage the [numerous components required](/learn/tanssi/overview/#what-tanssi-provides){target=\_blank} for a network to run smoothly.

Running a healthy decentralized protocol not only requires a robust governance mechanism to ensure that decisions are made transparently but also aligning incentives and coordinating among several ecosystem actors, including appchain developers, node operators, sequencer operators, data availability and RPC providers, as well as general users. The Tanssi token serves as the backbone, providing the economic mechanisms necessary to coordinate, incentivize proper behavior, and secure the entire ecosystem. It enables a verifiable and code-enforced protocol evolution through a fully on-chain decision-making process.

The token has several utilities:

- **On-chain governance**: token holders can use the token to propose and vote in governance decisions, such as software upgrades, how to spend treasury funds, change protocol rules, and more.
- **Appchain deployment**: use the token to register and launch your appchain in minutes.
- **Sequencing as a service payment**: use the token to keep your appchain live.
- **Sequencing and operator services rewarding**: get tokens as rewards for your nodes' services.
- **Staking on sequencers**: token holders can stake on sequencers, getting rewards with no risk of slashing.
- **Staking on operators**: token holders can stake on operators, getting rewards for their validation services.
- **Fees payment**: use the token to pay the fees for interacting with the Tanssi network.

!!! note
    All transaction fees on Tanssi are paid using the token, with the full amount going directly to fund the protocol's treasury account. These funds can only be spent via governance.

## Token Representations {: #token-representations }

The Tanssi network is built using the Substrate framework, leveraging its modular architecture and high performance. Therefore, the native token is of a Substrate type. The protocol's minting and burning mechanisms happen on the Tanssi network side, or, in other words, happen on the Substrate token representation.

Additionally, the Tanssi protocol relies on [external security providers](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank}, such as [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}, to secure the ecosystem through restaked assets. This restaking mechanism is implemented on Ethereum; therefore, an ERC-20 version of the token also exists to cover user cases on the Ethereum side.

Leveraging Tanssi's [built-in bridging capabilities](/learn/tanssi/tanssi-ethereum-bridge/){target=\_blank}, the token can be converted to (and from) the ERC-20  representation on Ethereum. When the token is bridged to Ethereum, the tokens are locked in the bridge's sovereign account, and a message is sent to the Ethereum contract to mint the equivalent amount in ERC-20. This lock-and-mint mechanism ensures the ERC-20 version is created through a trustless bridging mechanism, maintaining a 1:1 relationship with the native token.

### Tanssi (Substrate) - Native Token {: #tanssi-substrate }

The native Tanssi token exists on the Tanssi network as a Substrate-based asset and is the original form of the token that powers the core protocol operations.

This token uses as [Sr25519 subtrate-type account](/learn/tanssi/account-types/#key-types-in-tanssi-protocol){target=\_blank}, so it requires a wallet such as [Talisman](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/talisman/){target=\_blank} or any other [substrate-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/wallets/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    The Tanssi (Substrate) native token has twelve (12) decimal places.

### Tanssi (ERC-20) - Ethereum Representation {: #tanssi-erc-20 }

Tanssi's ERC-20 version is a standard Ethereum token that represents the native token on the Ethereum network. This version is created through the trustless bridging mechanism, utilizing a lock-and-mint strategy, thereby maintaining a 1:1 relationship with the native token. 

This token, like any other Ethereum asset, uses an [ECDSA account](/learn/tanssi/account-types/#key-types-in-tanssi-protocol){target=\_blank}, so it requires a wallet such as [Metamask](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank} or any other [Ethereum-compatible wallet](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/){target=\_blank}.

!!! note
    The Tanssi (ERC-20) has twelve (12) decimal places.

# JSON-RPC API Methods

## Standard Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #standard-rpc-methods }

As Tanssi's EVM Compatibility is derived from [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} and closely modeled after Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility, Tanssi nodes support a wide variety of standard supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods.

Nevertheless, not all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported; some of those supported return default values (those related to Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism in particular). This guide provides a comprehensive list of supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods on Tanssi.

## Custom JSON-RPC Methods {: #custom-json-rpc-methods }

Tanssi nodes support two custom JSON-RPC endpoints: `frnt_isBlockFinalized` and `frnt_isTxFinalized`. Tanssi features deterministic finality (as opposed to probabilistic like Bitcoin's finality), which means that at any point of time, the answer to whether a block or transaction is finalized or not can be answered with a definitive yes or no. Tanssi has built these two custom endpoints to provide valuable functionality for checking the finality of on-chain events.

???+ function "frnt_isBlockFinalized - checks for the finality of the block given by its block hash"

    === "Parameters"

        - `block_hash` ++"string"++ - the hash of the block, accepts either Substrate-style or Ethereum-style block hash as its input

    === "Returns"

        ++"boolean"++ - `true` if the block is finalized, `false` if the block is not finalized or not found

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "frnt_isBlockFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_BLOCK_HASH"]
        }' {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
        ```

???+ function "frnt_isTxFinalized - checks for the finality of a transaction given its EVM transaction hash"

    === "Parameters"

        - `tx_hash` ++"string"++ - the EVM transaction hash of the transaction 

    === "Returns"

        ++"boolean"++ - `true` if the transaction is finalized, `false` if the transaction is not finalized or not found

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "frnt_isTxFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH"]
