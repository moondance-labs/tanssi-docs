# JSON-RPC API Methods

## Standard Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods {: #standard-rpc-methods }

As Tanssi's EVM Compatibility is derived from [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier){target=\_blank} and closely modeled after Moonbeam's Ethereum compatibility, Tanssi nodes support a wide variety of standard supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods.

Nevertheless, not all Ethereum JSON-RPC methods are supported; some of those supported return default values (those related to Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism in particular). This guide provides a comprehensive list of supported Ethereum JSON-RPC methods on Tanssi. Developers can quickly reference this list to understand the available functionality for interfacing with Tanssi EVM networks.

The basic JSON-RPC methods from the Ethereum API supported by Tanssi are:

## Custom JSON-RPC Methods {: #custom-json-rpc-methods }

Tanssi nodes support two custom JSON-RPC endpoints: `frnt_isBlockFinalized` and `frnt_isTxFinalized`. Tanssi features deterministic finality (as opposed to probabilistic like Bitcoin's finality), which means that at any point of time, the answer to whether a block or transaction is finalized or not can be answered with a definitive yes or no. Tanssi has built these two custom endpoints to provide valuable functionality for checking the finality of on-chain events.

???+ function "frnt_isBlockFinalized - checks for the finality of the block given by its block hash"

    === "Parameters"

        - `block_hash` ++"string"++ - the hash of the block, accepts either Substrate-style or Ethereum-style block hash as its input

    === "Returns"

        ++"boolean"++ - `true` if the block is finalized, `false` if the block is not finalized or not found

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "frnt_isBlockFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_BLOCK_HASH"]
        }' {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
        ```

???+ function "frnt_isTxFinalized - checks for the finality of a transaction given its EVM transaction hash"

    === "Parameters"

        - `tx_hash` ++"string"++ - the EVM transaction hash of the transaction 

    === "Returns"

        ++"boolean"++ - `true` if the transaction is finalized, `false` if the transaction is not finalized or not found

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{
          "jsonrpc": "2.0",
          "id": "1",
          "method": "frnt_isTxFinalized",
          "params": ["INSERT_TRANSACTION_HASH"]
        }' {{ networks.dancelight.demo_evm_rpc_url }}
        ```
