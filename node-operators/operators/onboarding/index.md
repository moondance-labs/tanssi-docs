# Onboarding

One of Tanssi's core propositions for builders is that it provides Ethereum-grade economic security to every Tanssi-powered network, regardless of its TVL, userbase, or the specifics of the use case. Tanssi's design offers developers a shared security model, alleviating them from having to source enough economic security or negotiate with operators to run nodes opting in for their networks. 

The Tanssi protocol achieves this by integrating with [external security providers](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/){target=\_blank}, such as [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}. In this model, different [vaults](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/#vaults){target=\_blank} associated with Tanssi provide economic security, and reliable operators provide validation services to the Tanssi network.

Follow these steps to set up your node and prepare your account for active participation in the Tanssi protocol.
