# Node Operators

Operating nodes is a crucial part of maintaining a blockchain ecosystem, and Tanssi ensures that this process is as seamless as possible. From running network nodes and managing sequencers to onboarding validators, this section provides everything you need to get started and operate efficiently.

Whether you're setting up for the first time, handling operational tasks, or retiring your node, these guides offer clear and concise instructions to help you maintain secure and reliable operations.

### Node Types in the Tanssi Ecosystem

Understanding the roles of different nodes in the Tanssi-powered network helps you choose the right one based on your desired level of participation in the Tanssi ecosystem:

- [**Network nodes**](/node-operators/network-node/) - provide RPC endpoints and data availability services for smooth data flow and interaction between chains and users
- [**Sequencers**](/node-operators/sequencers/) - responsible for block production within the Tanssi ecosystem, sequencers collect transactions, execute them, and compile them in blocks, keeping liveness and operational continuity for all the Tanssi-powered networks
- [**Validators**](/node-operators/validators/) - also known as network operators, validators are responsible for securing the ecosystem. They verify every block produced by sequencers within Tanssi-powered networks, checking that the included transactions are valid. Validators must register and stake in the security provider (e.g., [Symbiotic](/learn/tanssi/external-security-providers/symbiotic/){target=\_blank}). They also produce blocks for the Tanssi network itself, keeping its liveness
