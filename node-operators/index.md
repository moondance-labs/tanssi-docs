# Node Operators
Learn how to become a critical part of the Tanssi ecosystem by running an RPC node or a block producer. Whether you're providing access to your appchain or actively participating in block production, this section guides you through the setup and management of nodes, ensuring seamless operation and contributing to the stability and security of the network.

# Block Producer Node
Discover how to set up, run, and manage block producers, also known as sequencers or collators, to play a key role in the Tanssi infrastructure. By participating in block production, you contribute to network stability while earning rewards for your efforts. This section provides all the tools and knowledge you need to get started.
