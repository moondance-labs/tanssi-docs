# Node Operators

Operating nodes is a crucial part of maintaining a blockchain ecosystem, and Tanssi ensures that this process is as seamless as possible. From running network nodes and managing sequencers to onboarding validators, this section provides everything you need to get started and operate efficiently.

Whether you're setting up for the first time, handling operational tasks, or retiring your node, these guides offer clear and concise instructions to help you maintain secure and reliable operations.

### Node Types in the Tanssi Ecosystem

Understanding the roles of different nodes in the Tanssi-powered network helps you choose the right one based on your goals:

- **Network nodes** - these nodes provide RPC endpoints and data availability services, ensuring smooth data flow and interaction between chains and users
- **Sequencers** - Sequencers are responsible for producing blocks, executing transactions, and maintaining the network's liveness by ensuring its operational continuity
