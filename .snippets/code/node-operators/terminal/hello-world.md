    <br> Hello from Docker!
    <br> This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    <br> 
    <br> To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    <br> 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    <br> 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    <br>     (amd64)
    <br> 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    <br>     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    <br> 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    <br>     to your terminal.
    <br>
    <br> To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
    <br> $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
    <br>
