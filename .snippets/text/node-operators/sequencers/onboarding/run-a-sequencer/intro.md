One of Tanssi's core propositions is that it provides decentralized and trustless block producers (also referenced as sequencers or collators) for its appchains. Tanssi's runtime handles block production assignments to all the active appchains in the Tanssi ecosystem and Tanssi itself.

Each time, the assignment algorithm distributes the available block producers per session, assigning them to a random chain (Tanssi or appchain). Consequently, they would be producing blocks for the same appchain only for a relatively short period, increasing the overall security of the ecosystem.

To this end, Tanssi's binary file (the software used to run nodes) already has an embedded mechanism to switch block production automatically to the assigned chain without requiring the node operator to make any changes. The binary includes the logic to sync the new chain and produce blocks when the session changes. Consequently, block producers need to run the Tanssi binary file, and not that of the appchains (like full nodes).
