# What is Polkadot ?

## Polkadot in a nutshell

Polkadot is an innovative a chain of chains, designed to address some major challenges present in other existing networks providing a more scalable, interoperable, secure, and customizable ecosystem in the blockchain space.

## Main features

Polkadot is layer 0 blockchain that offers essential services to other chains within the ecosystem, including security, consensus and interoperability/communication, leaving the implementation of specific use cases to the parachains while tackling these common problems:

1. Scalability: Polkadot's sharded model allows for the parallel processing of transactions across multiple parachains, significantly improving scalability and overall network capacity while lowering processing times and fees. 
2. Interoperability: While most blockchain networks operate in isolation, making it difficult for them to communicate and share assets, Polkadot provide native interoperability through XCM (Cross Consensus Message Format), connecting multiple chains facilitating asset transfer capabilities and information exchange.
3. Governance and Upgrades: Polkadot introduces an on-chain governance model, empowering token holders to participate in decision-making and allowing for efficient upgrades and protocol improvements.
4. Security: In smaller blockchain networks, security can be a concern due to lower levels of mining or staking participation. Polkadotâ€™s model of shared security guarantees the same high security level even for the smaller parachain within the ecosystem.
5. Customizability/flexibility: Polkadot's architecture encourages the creation of sovereign blockchains with high specialization, enabling developers to design chains with specific features and functionalities optimized for the unique requeriments of the use case.

The Polkadot Relay Chain serves as the main network that coordinates the overall operation of the platform providing shared security, consensus, and interoperability amongst the connected parachains, to accelerate the development of the web3.

## The technology behind

Polkadot -and the parachains- are built with an open-source blockchain development framework called Substrate, which is bases on Rust programming language.

Substrate makes it easy for teams to develop blockchains, providing pre built core functinalities such as consensus mechanisms, staking & governance, account and assets management, networking and many more ready to use modules and libraries.

The core principles of Substrate are ease of use and performance, allowing teams to create specialized blockchains for any use case, with high level of performance, flexibility, and robustness.
