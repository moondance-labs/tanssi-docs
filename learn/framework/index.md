    ---

    Substrate is a blockchain development framework built in Rust Programming Language that streamlines and speeds up the process of developing new appchains.

    [Overview](overview.md)

-   :octicons-stack-24:{ .lg .center } __Framework Architecture__

    ---

    Substrate is a software development kit (SDK) for building blockchains. This framework is the foundation and engine powering many projects across the Web3 ecosystem, including the Tanssi network itself and the appchains deployed through Tanssi.

    ---

    Substrate Framework provides complete and ready-to-use implementations of the main functions a Tanssi appchain needs to work properly, including cryptography, consensus, governance, and so on. These implementations are fully customizable and could be replaced with custom logic if needed.

    ---

    All Tanssi appchains have an inherent capability to communicate and interoperate with any other appchain in the ecosystem. This native cross-chain communication feature is possible thanks to the unique infrastructure the appchains are built on top of, leveraging the Cross-Consensus Message format (XCM for short), which facilitates communication between different consensus systems.
