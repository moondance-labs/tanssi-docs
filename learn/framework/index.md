# Appchain Development Framework

Building a blockchain from scratch is an intricate process, demanding deep knowledge of consensus algorithms, cryptography, data structures, governance, and more. With Tanssi, you can bypass these complexities and focus entirely on your vision. The Appchain Development Framework offers a streamlined approach to creating tailored blockchains, leveraging Substrate's powerful architecture to handle every essential internal component of a blockchain.

Designed for flexibility, this framework allows you to adapt runtime characteristics, integrate pre-built modules, or create new ones based on your appchain’s specific needs. Whether it’s enhancing core functionality, optimizing for scalability, or enabling seamless user interactions, Tanssi provides the foundation to bring your blockchain ideas to life.

Key Features of the Framework:

- **Substrate Core Architecture:** Divided into the **Core Client**, which manages external communications and internal responsibilities like storage, and the **Runtime**, which executes transactions and manages state transitions with customizable logic
- **End-User Simplicity:** The internal workings of the framework are abstracted for end-users, ensuring seamless interaction through dApps or RPC endpoints, such as wallets.
- **Modular System Design:** Incorporate pre-built modules or create custom ones to meet specific needs
- **Developer-Centric Flexibility:** Focus on runtime characteristics and use case specifics, allowing you to create a blockchain tailored to your vision without unnecessary complexity.
