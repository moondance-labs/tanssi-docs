# Network Development Framework

Building a blockchain from scratch is an intricate process that demands deep knowledge of consensus algorithms, cryptography, data structures, governance, and more. Tanssi simplifies this process by leveraging Substrate, a powerful blockchain development framework that provides all the essential components for creating customized blockchains.

With Substrate’s modular architecture, you can modify runtime characteristics, integrate pre-built modules, or develop new ones based on your network’s specific needs. Tanssi provides the foundation you need to bring your blockchain vision to life.

Key Features of the framework:

- **Substrate core architecture** - divided into the _core client_, which manages external communications and internal responsibilities like storage, and the _runtime_, which executes transactions and manages state transitions with customizable logic
- **End-user simplicity** - the internal workings of the framework are abstracted for end-users, ensuring seamless interaction through dApps or via RPC endpoints, such as those used by wallets
- **Modular system design** - incorporate pre-built modules or create custom ones to meet specific needs
- **Developer-centric flexibility** - focus on runtime characteristics and use case specifics, allowing you to create a blockchain tailored to your vision without unnecessary complexity
