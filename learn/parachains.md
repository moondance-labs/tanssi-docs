# What is Parachain in Polkadot ?

## Introduction

In order to gain an understanding of the concept of a parachain, let us begin with a very brief introduction to Polkadot.

Polkadot is a multi chain platform that presents a fresh approach to address significant challenges found in other popular blockchains, such as scalability and flexibility.
As a layer 0 blockchain, Polkadot primarily offers essential services to other chains within the ecosystem, including security, consensus and interoperability/communication, leaving the implementation of specific use cases to the parachains.

More specialization leads to better performance, and parachains are sovereign blockchains with high specialization that are interconnected through the relay chain. Each parachain process transactions in parallel utilizing a sharded execution model.

In addition to performance gains to the whole network, parachains can communicate with one another, enabling the transfer of assets and/or data and facilitating interoperability while relying on the security model offered by the relay chain.

Summing up, in the context of Polkadot, a parachain refers to an independent blockchain operating within the Polkadot network. Parachains leverage the interoperability, scalability, shared security and governance features provided by the Polkadot ecosystem. This empowers developers to create specialized blockchains that seamlessly interact with other parachains.

## How can I get my parachain up and running ?

To add a parachain to the Polkadot ecoystem, you will need obtain a slot through the slot auction process. 
Here's a general overview of what to do:

1. Prepare your parachain: Develop and prepare your parachain project, including its functionality, features, and any necessary code implementation.
2. Get DOT tokens: Since acquiring a parachain slot requires an amount of DOT tokens to be locked up (bonded) for the entire duration of the lease, you'll need to find an entity or community willing to support your parachain.
3. Participate in the auction: Polkadot uses a candle auction mechanism to allocate parachain slots. During the auction, you will compete against other projects for the available slots by submitting a bid in the form of locked DOT tokens. The highest bidders at the moment of the auction's close will get the parachain slots.
4. Deploy and maintain your parachain: Once you have secured a parachain slot, you can deploy your parachain onto the Polkadot network. 
It's crucial to ensure the proper configuration, security measures, ongoing maintenance of your parachain and a good number of collators.
