# Toolkit

The Toolkit section is your all-in-one resource hub for building, deploying, and managing Tanssi appchains. It brings together Ethereum and Substrate tools, such as libraries, development environments, precompiles, JSON-RPC methods, and more. Whether you're enhancing an existing appchain or implementing new features, this toolkit gives you everything you need to simplify the development and operation of your appchain.

!!! tip
    If you are working with an EVM-compatible network, you can use the Substrate tools to interact with the lower-level functionalities of your network. Using this, you can interact with custom runtime modules, query storage, manage governance, or work with features unique to Substrate.
