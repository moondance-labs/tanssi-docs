# Toolkit

The Toolkit section is your all-in-one resource hub for building, deploying, and managing Tanssi appchains. It brings together Ethereum and Substrate tools, wallets, libraries, development environments, precompiles, JSON-RPC methods, and integrations. Beyond appchain development, it also includes features for account management, proxy accounts, on-chain identities, and network endpoints.
Whether you’re starting from scratch or enhancing an existing appchain, this toolkit equips you with everything you need to succeed.
