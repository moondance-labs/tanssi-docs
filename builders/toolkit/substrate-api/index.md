# Substrate Tools

When developing on Tanssi or any Tanssi-powered network, it's important to understand the underlying infrastructure that drives these chains. Built on top of the Substrate framework, these networks offer a robust and flexible foundation for building decentralized applications and services. Interacting with the Substrate API is key to engaging with the blockchain's core functionalities.

Whether you're building decentralized applications (dApps), deploying smart contracts, or querying blockchain data, having the right tools and workflows to interact with this API will help you streamline development and ensure seamless integration with the network.
