# Set Up Your Workspace

Building on Substrate involves working with a flexible, modular blockchain framework. Unlike traditional blockchains, Substrateâ€™s pallet-based architecture allows developers to create custom blockchains and integrate specialized features, which requires a development environment tailored to its complexities.

In this section, you'll explore tools and techniques that can help you achieve the following with a Substrate development environment:

**Local environment setup** - spin up a test environment without dealing with the complexity of configuring a Substrate node manually
**Network interaction** - connect to and interact with Tanssi and Tanssi-powered networks
**Transaction simulation** - test and simulate transactions on forked networks to evaluate changes before deploying
**Debugging** - use debugging tools to troubleshoot and analyze transaction flow, state transitions, and more in a controlled environment
