Establishing an effective development environment is essential for building, testing, and deploying custom blockchains with Substrate. A development environment provides the necessary tools and frameworks to:

- Develop runtime logic with Substrateâ€™s modular framework.
- Test and debug locally using tools like Chopsticks.
- Manage dependencies and automate workflows for faster deployments.

### **Using Chopsticks**

Chopsticks is a developer-friendly tool designed to enhance the development process for Substrate-based blockchains. It allows developers to locally fork existing chains, replay blocks to examine how transactions affect the state, and test custom blockchain configurations in a local environment without deploying a live network
