# Libraries

Libraries are reusable pieces of code designed to simplify complex programming tasks. In blockchain development, libraries enable developers to interact with networks more efficiently, reducing development time and increasing reliability.

Main Benefits of Development Libraries:

- **Efficiency:** Accelerate development by utilizing pre-built functions and modules.
- **Reliability:** Leverage well-tested code to minimize errors and enhance security.
- **Interoperability:** Ensure seamless integration with tools and platforms in Substrate-based environments
