# Libraries

As Tanssi and Tanssi-powered networks are built on Substrate, developers can utilize libraries tailored to the Substrate API to tap into the network’s distinctive features.

These libraries streamline the interaction with Substrate’s modular architecture, helping you navigate the complexities of custom modules with ease and accelerate your development process.

Some key capabilities of working with libraries include:

- **Transaction management** - build and sign transactions for submitting extrinsics (state changes) to the blockchain
- **Interaction with custom modules** - invoke a module's exposed functions, to query chain data or trigger state changes
- **Account management** - create cryptographic key pairs for signing transactions and manage on-chain account information such as balances
