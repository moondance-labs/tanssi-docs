# Integrate RainbowKit with a Tanssi Appchain 

## Introduction 

[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank} is a React library that adds wallet connection capabilities to a dApp. It supports numerous wallets and enables features such as switching connection chains, ENS address resolution, and balance display out-of-the-box. RainbowKit offers customization options for all EVM-compatible chains, making it possible to connect wallets to an appchain easily.


RainbowKit bundles together multiple tools to simplify adding wallet connections to a dApp:

- [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/){target=\_blank} - a React Hooks library for interacting with Ethereum accounts, wallets, contracts, transactions, signing, ENS, and more
- [viem](https://viem.sh/){target=\_blank} - TypeScript interface which provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum
- [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank} - adds encrypted connections and enhanced UX experiences like connecting a mobile wallet by scanning a QR code
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview){target=\_blank} - helps manage and update server state within the application

This guide explains how to add RainbowKit to a dApp running on top of a Tanssi-powered appchain using the CLI, along with options for further customizing the integration.

## Quick Start {: #quick-start }

To start a new project, RainbowKit can scaffold a project using the CLI, combining RainbowKit and Wagmi in a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} application. Use your preferred package manager to run the CLI command and start the project:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
    ```
=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn create @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
    ```

The script will prompt for a project name, generate a new directory with the boilerplate starter code, and install all required dependencies. 

--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/cli-quickstart.md'

Navigate to the project directory, start the development server, and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){target=\_blank} to view the project locally:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    npm run dev 
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    cd INSERT_PROJECT_NAME
    yarn dev
    ```

The starting screen should look like this:

![Scaffolded RainbowKit project landing page](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-1.webp)

Open the project in a code editor and examine the directory and file structure, paying particular attention to the `wagmi.ts` file. This file allows configuration of the chains included in the list of networks that users can connect to via the dApp.

Since the [demo EVM appchain](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo/){target=\_blank} is a custom appchain on Tanssi, it cannot be imported directly from `wagmi/chains`. Instead, define the chain manually in the `wagmi.ts` file. For example, if the appchain uses the Tanssi demo appchain or another EVM-compatible chain, the necessary configurations must be added manually.

Here is the configuration for the demo EVM appchain on Tanssi:

=== "Demo EVM Appchain"
    ```js title="src/wagmi.ts"
    --8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/wagmi.ts'
    ```

To add support for the demo EVM appchain on Tanssi, update `wagmi.ts` as shown above. The following section explains how to generate the `projectId` value for WalletConnect.

## Manual Setup 

The following sections will walk you through the steps to integrate RainbowKit into an existing React application, such as installing and importing the necessary dependencies, configuring chain connections, and making the RainbowKit functionality available to users in the dApp. The setup will also include steps to specify which chain the **Connect Wallet** button should connect to by default and how to customize the RainbowKit theme to fit the project. This guide is based on the Tanssi [demo EVM appchain](https://apps.tanssi.network/demo){target=\_blank}, but can be adapted for your own Tanssi EVM appchain by changing the RPC URL parameter.

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- A Tanssi EVM-compatible appchain

- An existing dApp built with [React](https://react.dev/){target=\_blank}

- The [RainbowKit examples repository](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples){target=\_blank} includes templates for multiple React frameworks
    
 - To follow this guide, visit [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs){target=\_blank} and follow the **Automatic Installation** instructions, selecting Typescript and the App Router options during setup 

- The wallet must support custom networks, as the Tanssi demo EVM appchain will be added manually

- A WalletConnect `projectId` - every dApp relying on WalletConnect is required to have an associated `projectId`. It is free to create an account,  and an ID can be generated instantly

    To obtain a WalletConnect `projectId`:

    1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/){target=\_blank}
    2. On the **Projects** page, select **Create** 
    3. Add the project information (leaving the **Homepage URL** blank if the dApp is not deployed)
    4. Select the **AppKit** SDK
    5. Select a coding environment or platform (React is used in this guide)
    6. Locate the `projectId` in the left menu. or find it in the **Get started** code snippet of WalletConnect Quickstart
 
### Getting Started {: #getting-started }

Ensure that the project is in the root directory before proceeding, then install RainbowKit and its peer dependencies:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem@2.x @tanstack/react-query
    ```
These packages provide the core functionality for wallet connections (RainbowKit), Ethereum interactions (wagmi and viem), and state management (TanStack Query).

Next, start the development server to create a local dApp instance:

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

=== "pnpm"

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

After starting the server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000){target=\_blank},  to view the Next.js application in the browser.

To test the RainbowKit connection, the MetaMask app can be used. Ensure that the Tanssi demo EVM appchain is connected in the MetaMask wallet.

To add the Tanssi demo EVM appchain to MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask and go to Settings > Networks > Add Network.
2. Input the following information:
    - Network Name: `Demo EVM Chain`
    - RPC URL: `{{ networks.dancebox.rpc_url }}`
    - Chain ID: `{{ networks.dancebox.chain_id }}`
    - Currency Symbol: `{{ networks.dancebox.token_symbol }}`
    - Block Explorer URL: `{{ networks.dancebox.block_explorer_url }}`

For detailed instructions on connecting MetaMask to the Tanssi demo EVM appchain, refer to the guide [Connect MetaMask to your Tanssi EVM Appchain](https://docs.tanssi.network/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/#connect-metamask-to-evm-appchain){target=\_blank}.

After connecting, `the projectId` can be safely added to the application:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project

    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

2. Add the `projectId` to this file

    ```text title=".env.local"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID='INSERT_PROJECT_ID'
    ```

3. Locate the `.gitignore` file in this same directory and ensure `.env*.local` is included in the list of files to ignore. This will prevent committing the `projectId` to GitHub

The stored `projectId` will be required for configuring the `wagmi` settings in the upcoming section.

### Connect DApp to MetaMask 

With the development environment set up and MetaMask configured for the Tanssi demo EVM appchain, the next step is to configure the dApp to connect with MetaMask's wallet using RainbowKit. This process involves the following key steps:

1. Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query
2. Setup configuration for Wagmi
3. Wrap the application with providers
4. Add the connect button

### Import RainbowKit, Wagmi, and TanStack Query

To proceed, ensure the project is in the root directory, and then create a new file called `wagmi.ts`. This file will contain the necessary imports and configurations to connect the dApp to wallets and interact with blockchains.

```bash
touch wagmi.ts
```
In `wagmi.ts`, import the necessary libraries and define Demo EVM Chain as the supported chain:

```ts title="wagmi.ts"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/wagmi2.ts'
```

### Wrap the Application with Providers

Next, create a file named `providers.tsx` to wrap the application with the necessary providers: `WagmiProvider`, and `QueryClientProvider`.

```bash
cd app &&
touch providers.tsx
```

Open `providers.tsx` add the following code to manage the providers

```ts title="providers.tsx"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/providers1.tsx'
```

Now locate the `layout.tsx` file inside the `app` directory and modify the code to import `Providers` and wrap the application:

```ts title="layout.tsx"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/layout.tsx'
```
This ensures that the app is wrapped with all necessary providers, including wagmi, and TanStack Query for state management.

### Add the Connect Button

RainbowKit offers a `ConnectButton` component, which renders the **Connect** and **Disconnect** buttons and UI elements for switching chains. This example imports the `ConnectButton` into the existing `page.tsx` file for simplicity, though it can also be added to an element like a **Header** or **Navbar** to appear at the top of every page. Update the code in `page.tsx` as follows:

```ts title="page.tsx"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/pages.tsx'
```

Once the development server is running, the home page will display a **Connect Wallet** button. Clicking this button will open the RainbowKit modal, providing options to either connect an existing wallet or get a new one. Select **MetaMask** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection process.

The current configuration defaults to connecting to Demo EVM Chain and displays the current network, the native token balance, and the connected wallet address. If multiple networks are supported, selecting the arrow next to it will open the Switch Networks modal. This allows users to select another network and authorize the change.

Once connected, users will see their {{ networks.dancebox.token_symbol }} token balance and wallet address.

## Customize RainbowKit

RainbowKit simplifies the complexities of managing wallet connections while offering various options for customizing UI and functionality to fit the needs of a dApp. A full list of customization options can be found in the RainbowKit [documentation](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/introduction){target=\_blank}. This section covers customizing the **Connect Wallet** button to connect initially to the Demo EVM Chain and render it in a custom color. 

### Set Custom Initial Chain

By default, RainbowKit connects to the first chain supplied to Wagmi in the config. The order of chains listed in `wagmi.ts` will match the order displayed in the **Switch Networks** modal. To ensure that the Tanssi demo EVM appchain is always the default connection, simply move it to the top of the chain list. However, Relying solely on this default behavior might not be the best option.

A better approach is to use the `initialChain` prop in the `RainbowKitProvider` component. This prop defines which chain the wallet will connect to initially when **Connect Wallet** is selected. To configure this, open the `providers.tsx` file and update the code by passing the `initialChain` prop with the custom Tanssi demo EVM appchain object defined earlier:

```Ts title="providers.tsx"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/providers.tsx'
```

By setting `initialChain={demoEVMChain}`, RainbowKit will attempt to connect to the Tanssi demo EVM appchain first whenever the **Connect Wallet** button is clicked.

### Define Custom Theme Colors

RainbowKit provides three built-in theme functions: `lightTheme`, `darkTheme`, and `midnightTheme`. These functions return a theme object that can be passed to the `RainbowKitProvider` prop `theme` to customize colors, border radius, font stack, and overlay blur. Update `providers.tsx` with the following code and ensure that `darkTheme` is added to the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` import statement for the changes to apply correctly. After customizing the initial chain and theme, the `providers.tsx` file will look like this:

```js title="providers.tsx"
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/providers2.tsx'
```
This configuration sets a dark theme with custom properties:

- `accentColor` - the primary highlight color. In this example, Tanssi's accent color (#189B9B) is used, but it can be adjusted to match the branding of the dApp
- `accentColorForeground` - the text color used on top of the accent color
- `borderRadius` - controls the roundness of UI elements. Options are 'none', 'small', 'medium', or 'large'
- `fontStack` - defines the fonts used. 'system' uses the default system fonts
- `overlayBlur` - the blur effect applied to the background when modals are open

!!! tip
    Experiment with different theme functions (`lightTheme`, `darkTheme`, `midnightTheme`) and color combinations to find the best match for the visual style of the dApp.

## Handle Disconnections

To disconnect MetaMask from the dApp and reconnect for testing purposes, two methods can be used to complete this process.  

### Disconnect from DApp {: #disconnect-from-dapp }

RainbowKit includes a **Disconnect** button out of the box. To open the modal, select the arrow next to the account number. Click the **Disconnect** button. At this point, the **Connect Wallet** option will reappear, and the account information will no longer be visible.

![Built in Disconnect button](/images/builders/toolkit/integrations/wallet-integrations/rainbowkit/rainbowkit-2.webp)

### Disconnect from MetaMask  {: #disconnect-from-metamask }

Some users prefer to disconnect from their wallet rather than use a button within a dApp. To use this method: 

1. Select the MetaMask extension in the browser to open the modal
2. Select the three dots in the upper right corner of the MetaMask modal
3. Select **Connected sites**
4. Review the list of sites connected to the wallet
5. Select **Disconnect** for each site that should be disconnected

## Final Result {: #final-result }

The **Connect Wallet** button on the home page should now render in the color specified for `accentColor` during theme customization. After selecting **Connect Wallet**, the same accent color will be displayed in the modal. MetaMask can be chosen, and signing the transaction will authorize the connection. The Tanssi demo EVM appchain will appear as the connected network, along with the {{ networks.dancebox.token_symbol }} token balance, without the need for manual network switching.
