# Wallets Integrations

Wallet integrations are essential for enabling user interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) by allowing users to securely manage their digital assets, sign transactions, and authenticate their identity. These integrations provide developers with the tools to build applications that can interact with usersâ€™ wallets, facilitating blockchain transactions and interactions in a user-friendly manner.

Main features of wallet integraions include:

- **Multi-wallet support** - out-of-the-box support for multiple wallet providers, reducing the need for custom integration
- **Improved user experience** - users can easily connect using their preferred wallet via an intuitive user interface
- **Pre-built UI components** - ready-to-use UI components for  wallet connection, account display, and balance management, streamlining development
- **Customization** - customize the wallet modal's appearance and behavior to match your branding and user interface design
