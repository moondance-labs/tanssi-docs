# Oracles 

Blockchain oracles are services that enable blockchains to interact with external data sources, bridging the gap between smart contracts and real-world information. Oracles are essential for dynamic applications that rely on accurate and timely off-chain data.

Main Features of Blockchain Oracles:

- **External Connectivity:** Allow smart contracts to fetch and utilize real-world data.
- **Automation:** Trigger contract execution based on external conditions.
- **Flexibility:** Support various data types, such as price feeds, weather updates, and sports results.
