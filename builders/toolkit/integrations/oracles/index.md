# Oracles

Blockchain oracles are services that enable blockchains to interact with external data sources, bridging the gap between smart contracts and real-world information. Oracles are essential for dynamic applications that rely on accurate and timely off-chain data.

Main features of oracles include:

- **External connectivity** - allowing smart contracts to fetch and utilize real-world data
- **Automation** - trigger contract execution based on external conditions
- **Flexibility** - support various data types, such as price feeds, weather updates, and sports results
