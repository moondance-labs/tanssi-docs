# Indexers 

Indexers enable efficient ingestion, processing, and querying of blockchain data, providing developers with powerful tools to create responsive and data-rich applications on Tanssi-powered networks.

Main features of indexers include:

- **Improved data access speed** - faster querying of on-chain data by organizing and indexing it, enabling quicker retrieval times
- **Data aggregation** - ingest and transform data that is easier to query and work with large amounts of data
- **Enhanced querying capabilities** - use sophisticatd querying methods, such as filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Real-time data updates** - synchronization with the blockchain enables applications to access the latest information as soon as its available
