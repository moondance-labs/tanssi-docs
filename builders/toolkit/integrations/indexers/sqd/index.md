# SQD

SQD is a blockchain indexing and query service designed to make it easier for developers to build data-rich applications on Substrate-based chains, such as Tanssi-powered networks. It provides an efficient and scalable solution for processing, indexing, and querying on-chain data, allowing developers to easily interact with the blockchain data they need without dealing with the complexities of raw blockchain data directly.
