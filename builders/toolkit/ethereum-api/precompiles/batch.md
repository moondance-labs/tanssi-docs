# Interacting with the Batch Precompile

## Introduction {: #introduction }

The Batch Precompile contract on Tanssi EVM appchains allows developers to combine multiple EVM calls into one.

Currently, having users interact with multiple contracts would require multiple transaction confirmations in the user's wallet. An example would be approving a smart contract's access to a token and then immediately transferring it. With the Batch Precompile, developers can enhance user experience with batched transactions as it minimizes the number of transactions a user is required to confirm. Additionally, the gas fees paid by a user can be reduced since batching avoids multiple base gas fees (the initial 21000 units of gas spent to begin a transaction).

The precompile interacts directly with [Substrate's EVM pallet](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier){target=\_blank}. The caller of the batch function will have their address act as the `msg.sender` for all subtransactions, but unlike [delegate calls](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries){target=\_blank}, the target contract will still affect its own storage. It is effectively the same as if the user signed multiple transactions but with only one confirmation.

The Batch Precompile is located at the following address:

## The Batch Solidity Interface {: #the-batch-interface }

[`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Batch.sol){target=\_blank} is a Solidity interface that allows developers to interact with the precompile's three methods.

??? code "Batch.sol"

    ```solidity
    --8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch.sol'
    ```

The interface includes the following functions:

???+ function "**batchSome**(*address[]* to, *uint256[]* value, *bytes[]* callData, *uint64[]* gasLimit) — performs multiple calls, where the same index of each array combine into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, following subcalls will still be attempted"

    === "Parameters"

        - `to` - an array of addresses to direct subtransactions to, where each entry is a subtransaction
        - `value` - an array of native currency values to send in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all the following subtransactions will default to a value of 0
        - `callData` - an array of call data to include in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will include no call data
        - `gasLimit` - an array of gas limits in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. Values of 0 are interpreted as unlimited and will have all remaining gas of the batch transaction forwarded. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will have all remaining gas forwarded

??? function "**batchSomeUntilFailure**(*address[]* to, *uint256[]* value, *bytes[]* callData, *uint64[]* gasLimit) — performs multiple calls, where the same index of each array combine into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, no following subcalls will be executed"

    === "Parameters"

        - `to` - an array of addresses to direct subtransactions to, where each entry is a subtransaction
        - `value` - an array of native currency values to send in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all the following subtransactions will default to a value of 0
        - `callData` - an array of call data to include in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will include no call data
        - `gasLimit` - an array of gas limits in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. Values of 0 are interpreted as unlimited and will have all remaining gas of the batch transaction forwarded. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will have all remaining gas forwarded

??? function "**batchAll**(*address[]* to, *uint256[]* value, *bytes[]* callData, *uint64[]* gasLimit) — performs multiple calls atomically, where the same index of each array combine into the information required for a single subcall. If a subcall reverts, all subcalls will revert"

    === "Parameters"

        - `to` - an array of addresses to direct subtransactions to, where each entry is a subtransaction
        - `value` - an array of native currency values to send in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all the following subtransactions will default to a value of 0
        - `callData` - an array of call data to include in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will include no call data
        - `gasLimit` - an array of gas limits in the subtransactions, where the index corresponds to the subtransaction of the same index in the *to* array. Values of 0 are interpreted as unlimited and will have all remaining gas of the batch transaction forwarded. If this array is shorter than the *to* array, all of the following subtransactions will have all remaining gas forwarded

The interface also includes the following required events:

- **SubcallSucceeded**(*uint256* index) - emitted when a subcall of the given index succeeds
- **SubcallFailed**(*uint256* index) - emitted when a subcall of the given index fails

## Interact with the Solidity Interface {: #interact-with-the-solidity-interface }

### Checking Prerequisites {: #checking-prerequisites }

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have your wallet configured to work with your EVM appchain and an account funded with native tokens. You can add your EVM appchain to MetaMask with one click on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Or, you [configure MetaMask for Tanssi with the demo EVM appchain](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/wallets/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

### Example Contract {: #example-contract}

The contract `SimpleContract.sol` will be used as an example of batching contract interactions, but in practice, any contract can be interacted with.

```solidity
--8<-- 'code/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/simple-contract.sol'
```

### Remix Set Up {: #remix-set-up }

You can interact with the Batch Precompile using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org){target=\_blank}. You'll need a copy of [`Batch.sol`](https://github.com/moondance-labs/tanssi/blob/master/test/contracts/solidity/Batch.sol){target=\_blank} and `SimpleContract.sol`. To add the precompile to Remix and follow along with the tutorial, you will need to:

1. Click on the **File explorer** tab
2. Paste the `Batch.sol` contract into a Remix file named **Batch.sol**
3. Paste the `SimpleContract.sol` contract into a Remix file named **SimpleContract.sol**

### Compile the Contract {: #compile-the-contract }

Next, you will need to compile both files in Remix:

1. Make sure that you have the **Batch.sol** file open
2. Click on the **Compile** tab, second from top
3. To compile the contract, click on **Compile Batch.sol**

![Compiling Batch.sol](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-1.webp)

If the interface was compiled successfully, you will see a green checkmark next to the **Compile** tab.

### Access the Precompile {: #access-the-precompile }

Instead of deploying the Batch Precompile, you will access the interface given the address of the precompiled contract:

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix. Please note that the precompiled contract is already deployed
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - MetaMask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **Batch.sol** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown. Since this is a precompiled contract, there is no need to deploy any code. Instead, we are going to provide the address of the precompile in the **At Address** field
5. Provide the address of the Batch Precompile: `{{networks.dancebox.precompiles.batch}}` and click **At Address**

![Access the address](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-2.webp)

The **BATCH** precompile will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Deploy Example Contract {: #deploy-example-contract }

On the other hand, `SimpleContract.sol` will be deployed as a new contract. Before starting this section, repeat the [compilation step](#compile-the-contract) with the `SimpleContract.sol` file.

1. Click on the **Deploy and Run** tab directly below the **Compile** tab in Remix
2. Make sure **Injected Provider - MetaMask** is selected in the **ENVIRONMENT** dropdown. Once you select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**, you might be prompted by MetaMask to connect your account to Remix
3. Make sure the correct account is displayed under **ACCOUNT**
4. Ensure **SimpleContract** is selected in the **CONTRACT** dropdown
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Confirm the MetaMask transaction that appears by clicking **Confirm**

![Deploy SimpleContract](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-3.webp)

The **SIMPLECONTRACT** contract will appear in the list of **Deployed Contracts**.

### Send Native Currency via Precompile {: #send-native-currency-via-precompile }

Sending native currency with the Batch Precompile involves more than pressing a few buttons in Remix or MetaMask. For this example, you will be using the **batchAll** function to send native currency atomically.

Transactions have a value field to specify the amount of native currency sent. In Remix, this is determined by the **VALUE** input in the **DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS** tab. However, for the Batch Precompile, this data is provided within the **value** array input of the batch functions.

Try transferring the native token of your appchain to two wallets of your choice via the Batch Precompile:

1. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Expand the **batchAll** function
3. For the **to** input, insert your addresses in the following format: `["INSERT_ADDRESS_1", "INSERT_ADDRESS_2"]`, where the first address corresponds to the first wallet of your choice and the second address corresponds to the second wallet of your choice
4. For the **value** input, insert the amount you wish to transfer in Wei for each address. For example, `["1000000000000000000", "2000000000000000000"]` will transfer 1 native token to the first address and 2 native tokens to the second address
5. For **callData**, insert `[]`. Call data is not relevant for simply transferring the native token
6. For the **gasLimit** inputs, insert `[]`
7. Press **transact**
8. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Send Batch Transfer](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-4.webp)

Once the transaction is complete, you can check both of the accounts' balances, either in MetaMask or in your appchain's block explorer, a link to which can be found on the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank}. Congratulations! You've now sent a batched transfer via the Batch Precompile.

!!! note
     Typically if you wanted to send the native currency to or through a contract, you would have to set the value within the overall transaction object and interact with a payable function. However, since the Batch Precompile interacts directly with Substrate code, this is not a typical Ethereum transaction and is thus not necessary.

### Find a Contract Interaction's Call Data {: #find-a-contract-interactions-call-data }

Visual interfaces like [Remix](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/dev-env/remix/){target=\_blank} and handy libraries like [Ethers.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank} hide the way that Ethereum transactions interact with Solidity smart contracts. The name and input types of a function are hashed into a [function selector](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#function-selector-and-argument-encoding){target=\_blank} and the input data is encoded. These two pieces are then combined and sent as the transaction's call data. To send a subtransaction within a batch transaction, the sender needs to know its call data beforehand.

Try finding a transaction's call data using Remix:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. Expand the **setMessage** function
3. Enter the desired **id**, such as `1`
4. Enter the desired **message**, such as `"tanssi"`
5. Instead of sending the transaction, click the copy button next to the **transact** button to copy the call data

![Transaction Call Data](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-5.webp)

Now you have the transaction's call data! Considering the example values of `1` and `"tanssi"`, we can keep an eye out for their encoded values in the call data:

```text
0x648345c8                                                        // function selector
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001  // 1 id
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040  // 32 byte offset
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000   // 32 byte length
674616e7373690000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 // "tanssi" in bytes
```

The call data can be broken into five lines where:

 - The first line is the function selector
 - The second line is equal to 1, which is the **id** that was provided
 - What's left involves the **message** input. These last three lines are tricky since strings are a [dynamic type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/abi-spec.html#use-of-dynamic-types){target=\_blank} with a dynamic length. The third line refers to an offset to define where the string's data starts. The fourth line refers to the length of the message in the following line, which is 32 bytes total - the "tanssi" message plus padding
 
You can repeat the above steps to capture the call data for values of `2` and `"hello"` such that multiple subcalls can be submitted atomically with the Batch Precompile in the next section. 

### Function Interaction via Precompile {: #function-interaction-via-precompile }

This section's example will be using the **batchAll** function that will ensure the transactions are resolved atomically. Keep in mind that there are also two other batch functions that can either continue subtransactions despite errors or halt subsequent subtransactions but not revert previous ones.

Interacting with a function is very similar to [sending a native currency](#send-native-currency-via-precompile), since they are both transactions. However, call data is required to provide input to functions properly and a sender may desire to limit the amount of gas spent in each subtransaction.

The `callData` and `gasLimit` fields are more relevant for subtransactions that interact with contracts. For each function in the batch interface, the `callData` input is an array where each index corresponds to the call data for each recipient of the subtransaction, that is, each `to` input. If the size of the `callData` array is less than the `to` array, the remaining subtransactions will have no call data (functions with no inputs). The `gasLimit` input is an array that corresponds to the amount of gas that each can spend for each subtransaction. If its value at an index is 0 or the index is the size of the array or greater (and smaller than the `to` array's size), all of the remaining gas from the previous subtransaction is forwarded.

To use the precompile to send an atomic batch transaction combining two contract interactions, take the following steps:

1. Copy the `SimpleContract.sol` contract's address with the copy button on the right side of its header. Be sure also to have the [call data from the previous section](#find-a-contract-interactions-call-data)
2. Expand the batch contract under **Deployed Contracts**
3. Expand the **batchAll** function
4. For the **to** input, paste the address `SimpleContract.sol` as follows: `["INSERT_SIMPLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS","INSERT_SIMPLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"]`. Note that you'll need to repeat the address for as many transactions you are batching together, even if the contract address is the same
5. For the value input, since `SimpleContract.sol` does not require any native currency to be paid to it, insert `[0,0]` for 0 Wei
6. For the **callData** input, insert your call data from the previous section in the following format: `["INSERT_FIRST_CALL_DATA","INSERT_SECOND_CALL_DATA"]`
7. For the **gasLimit** input, insert `[]`. You can put in a gas limit value for each subcall, or leave it as an empty array
8. Press **transact**
9. Press **Confirm** in the MetaMask extension to confirm the transaction

![Batch Function Interaction](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-6.webp)

If you used the same call data as the tutorial, you can check to make sure that the transaction has been successful as follows:

1. Expand the `SimpleContract.sol` contract under **Deployed Contracts**
2. To the right of the **messages** button, insert `1`
3. Press the blue **messages** button

![SimpleContract Confirmation](/images/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/precompiles/batch/batch-7.webp)

The phrase **"tanssi"** should appear underneath it. You can repeat the above steps with an id of "2", and you should see **"hello"**. Congratulations! You have interacted with a function with the Batch Precompile.

### Combining Subtransactions {: combining-subtransactions }

So far, transferring native currency and interacting with functions have been separate, but they can be intertwined.

The following four strings can be combined as inputs for a batch transaction. They will send 1 native token to the public Gerald (`0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b`) account and interact with a predeployed `SimpleContract.sol` contract twice. Here is a break-down:

There are three subtransactions which correspond to three addresses in the `to` input array. The first is the public Gerald account and the following two are a `SimpleContract.sol` contract. You can replace the last two with your own instance of `SimpleContract.sol` if you wish. Or, replace only one: you can interact with multiple contracts in a single message.

```text
[
  "0x6Be02d1d3665660d22FF9624b7BE0551ee1Ac91b",
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39", 
  "0xd14b70a55F6cBAc06d4FA49b99be0370D0e1BD39"
]
```

There will also be three values for the `value` array. The first address in the `to` input array indicates `1000000000000000000` wei or `1` UNIT of the native token. Remember that the native tokens of Tanssi EVM appchains have [18 decimal points just like Ethereum](https://eth-converter.com){target=\_blank}. The following two values are `0` because the function that their subtransactions are interacting with does not accept or require native currency.  

```text
["1000000000000000000", "0", "0"]
```

You will need three values for the `callData` array. Since transferring native currency does not require call data, the string is simply blank. The second and third values in the array correspond to invocations of **setMessage** that set messages to IDs 5 and 6.

```text
[
  "0x", 
  "0x648345c8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000009796f752061726520610000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 
  "0x648345c800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e61206d6f6f6e6265616d2070726f000000000000000000000000000000000000"
]
```

The final input is for `gas_input`. This array will be left empty to forward all remaining gas to each subtransaction.

```text
[]
```

Try sending a batched transaction with these inputs in Remix the same way [you batched a function call](#function-interaction-via-precompile).

And that's it! You've successfully interacted with the ERC-20 precompile using MetaMask and Remix!

## Ethereum Development Libraries {: #ethereum-development-libraries }

If you have followed the [Ethers.js tutorial](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/ethersjs/){target=\_blank}, you may find it difficult to find the call data for a function. The answer is hidden within Ether's `Interface` object, where the [encodeFunctionData](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/abi/#Interface-encodeFunctionData){target=\_blank} function allows you to input your function name and inputs to receive the resultant call data. [Web3.js](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/libraries/web3js/){target=\_blank} has a similar function, [encodeFunctionCall](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-abi.html#encodefunctioncall){target=\_blank}.
