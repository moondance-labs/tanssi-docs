# Precompiles

Precompiles are specialized smart contracts embedded in the blockchain, designed to perform complex operations more efficiently than standard contracts. In Tanssi EVM ContainerChains, precompiles expose Substrate functions through the accessible Ethereum API. These guides demonstrate how to interact with precompiles, allowing you to take advantage of advanced features easily.

### Native Token ERC-20 

Easily interact with your appchain's native token through the ERC-20 standard. This precompile simplifies operations such as:

- Transferring tokens securely and efficiently.
- Querying account balances with Ethereum-compatible tools.
- Enabling seamless integration with other ERC-20-based systems.
