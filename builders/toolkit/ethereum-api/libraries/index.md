# Libraries

Libraries are essential tools for interacting with blockchain networks. They provide pre-built functions and abstractions that simplify tasks like reading and writing chain data. These libraries eliminate the need to handle raw blockchain requests, making it easier for developers to build and deploy decentralized applications while ensuring compatibility with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible networks.

Some key capabilities of working with libraries include:

- **Transaction management** - create, sign, and broadcast transactions
- **Smart contract interactions** - simplify calling contract functions, decoding responses, and handling contract events
- **Wallet integration** - facilitate secure wallet integrations for transacting with the network
- **Blockchain data parsing** - decode and interpret complex data structures returned by smart contracts
- **Event monitoring** - listen to events emitted by contracts and trigger specific application actions
