# Libraries

Libraries are reusable pieces of code designed to simplify complex programming tasks. In blockchain development, they are particularly useful for abstracting away the difficulties of working with decentralized networks. By leveraging libraries, developers can interact with the Ethereum network more efficiently, focusing on business logic rather than low-level implementation details.

What You Can Achieve with Libraries

- **Interact with Smart Contracts:** Simplify calling contract functions, handling responses, and managing events.
- **Connect User Wallets:** Facilitate secure wallet integrations for user authentication and transaction signing.
- **Decode Blockchain Data:** Easily parse and interpret complex data structures returned by smart contracts.
- **Manage Transactions:** Create, sign, and broadcast transactions while abstracting network-level details.
- **Monitor Blockchain Events:** Listen to events emitted by contracts and trigger specific application actions.
