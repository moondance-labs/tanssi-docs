# Custom Appchain

Tailor your appchain to meet your application's unique requirements. This section offers comprehensive guidance on modifying and extending your appchain's functionality, ensuring it aligns perfectly with your project's goals. Explore detailed instructions and best practices to customize every aspect of your appchain effectively.

## Set Up Your Environment

Before customizing your appchain, ensure your development environment is properly configured. This involves setting up essential tools and building the Tanssi template to ensure a smooth development process.

- Install Rust for compiling your appchain's code.
- Use Git to clone and manage the Tanssi repository.
- Set up the Rust toolchain to work with Substrate-based runtimes.
- Build the Tanssi template to establish a solid development foundation.

Tip: Follow our step-by-step guide to set up your environment efficiently.
