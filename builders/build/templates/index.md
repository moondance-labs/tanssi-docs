# Network Templates 

Kickstart your network development with our comprehensive templates. Designed for rapid deployment, these templates provide a strong foundation for both EVM and non-EVM solutions, accelerating your production journey.

## Choosing the Right Template

Selecting the right template is the first step in building your Tanssi-powered network. Whether you need a standard, fully customizable blockchain, or one that is EVM-compatible, both templates provide basic configurations, along with benefits like block production as a service, deterministic transaction finality, and the option to choose your security provider, such as [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/){target=\_blank}.

**Baseline template:**

- **Minimalistic design** - includes only the essential configurations for compatibility with Tanssi, making it an ideal base for adding custom modules
- **Tailored runtime** - provides the flexibility to expand functionality by integrating existing or custom-built modules
- **Highly configurable** - adapt the template to meet unique requirements for governance, economics, or consensus

**Baseline EVM template:**

- **Ready to deploy** - comes fully configured for Ethereum compatibility, requiring no runtime changes if the application is built on EVM
- **Ethereum ecosystem integration** - supports Ethereum tools and libraries like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){target=\_blank}, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/){target=\_blank}, [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/){target=\_blank}, and [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/){target=\_blank}
- **Smart contract deployment** - deploy EVM smart contracts seamlessly using familiar tools

Learn more about each template, the minimum requirements for your chain to function on Tanssi, and  what modules are automatically included on the [Template Overview](/builders/build/templates/overview/) page.
