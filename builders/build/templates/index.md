# Template Appchains

Kickstart your appchain development with our comprehensive templates. Designed for rapid deployment and flexibility, our templates provide a solid foundation for EVM and non-EVM solutions. Discover the perfect starting point for your project and accelerate your journey to production.

## Choosing the Right Template
Tanssi appchain templates provide foundational configurations to accelerate development and ensure compatibility with the ecosystem. Choose the right starting point for your appchain:

- **Baseline Tanssi Appchain Template:** A Substrate-based template designed for integrating custom logic into a Substrate-oriented runtime.
- **Baseline Tanssi EVM Appchain Template:** Offers Ethereum compatibility, enabling developers to deploy and interact with smart contracts on Tanssi.

Tip: To start building on our templates, the best approach is to fork the Tanssi repository and begin adding built-in or custom modules based on your specific requirements.
