# Account Management

Effectively manage accounts within your Tanssi appchain. This section provides tools and features to streamline account operations, improve governance, and ensure seamless integration within the ecosystem.

## **Delegating Account Permissions**

Proxy Accounts allow you to securely delegate actions to other accounts, improving flexibility and reducing risk. With Proxy Accounts, you can:

- Assign specific permissions to trusted accounts for tasks like staking or governance.
- Maintain the security of your main account while enabling automation.
- Easily add, manage, and revoke proxy accounts as needed.

## **Establishing On-Chain Identity**
On-Chain Identities improve interactions by providing verifiable credentials directly on the blockchain. Key benefits of On-Chain Identities include:

- Building trust and reputation within the network, essential for teams and appchain governors.
- Associating metadata, such as display names or verified credentials, with blockchain accounts.
- Simplifying identity verification for seamless interactions across the Tanssi ecosystem.
