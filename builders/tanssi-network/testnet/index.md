## TestNet

A TestNet is a blockchain environment used for testing and experimentation without real-world consequences. It enables developers to deploy, debug, and refine appchains safely before moving to production.

Main features of a TestNet:

- Free from economic risks, allowing for experimentation.
- Mirrors the functionality of a live network.
- Ideal for debugging and testing appchain configurations.
