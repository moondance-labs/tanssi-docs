# Get Started with Dancebox

## Introduction

Dancebox is the first public Tanssi TestNet and is designed to streamline the deployment of appchains. It allows teams to swiftly onboard and launch their appchains within minutes, providing a robust environment for testing and development.

This quick reference page offers all the essentials you need to get started on Dancebox.

## TestNet Tokens {: #testnet-tokens }

DANCE tokens serve as the native currency within the Dancebox Network. To initiate the deployment of an appchain on Dancebox, you'll need to obtain DANCE tokens. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Tanssi Network](https://www.tanssi.network/claim-dance-tokens){target=\_blank} website
2. Complete the form by providing basic information and your Substrate-based address
3. Within one business day of submitting the form, you'll receive DANCE tokens for testing

!!! note
    DANCE tokens have no value. Please don't submit unnecessary requests.
