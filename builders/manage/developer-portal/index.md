# Using the Developer Portal

The developer portal empowers you to efficiently manage your Tanssi-powered network operations, security, and customization. With intuitive tools at your disposal, you can ensure smooth management and tailor your network to meet your project's unique requirements.

## How to Connect to the Developer Portal

Before getting started, you need to retrieve your network's WS URL. This information is available on your network's **Dashboard** in the Tanssi dApp underneath the **Properties** section.
