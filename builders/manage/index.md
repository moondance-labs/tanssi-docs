# Managing Your Tanssi-Powered Network

The Tanssi dApp and the developer portal serve different purposes when managing your network, offering unique benefits tailored to your needs:

By removing technical complexities, it enables a faster and more streamlined experience for creating and managing networks. Some actions that can be performed via the dApp include:

    - [Managing tokens](/builders/manage/dapp/manage-tokens/) (i.e., minting and transferring tokens, updating balances, and more)

- **Developer portal** - built on Polkadot.js Apps, the developer portal provides advanced tools for network management, including runtime upgrades, token minting, and more. It is ideal for tasks requiring precise control and customization. Some actions that can be performed via the developer portal include:

    - [Managing the Sudo account](/builders/manage/developer-portal/sudo/)
