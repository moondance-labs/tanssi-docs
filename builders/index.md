# Builders

Explore everything you need to build, deploy, and manage networks within the Tanssi ecosystem. From development tools to account management and network connectivity, the content in this section enables you to move confidently from concept to implementation.

## Build and Manage a Tanssi-Powered Network

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   Where to Start?

    To begin building your Tanssi-powered network, you can choose one of two pathways:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Build a network from scratch using a template](/builders/build/templates/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Configure an existing Substrate-based runtime to be Tanssi compatible](/builders/build/templates/custom-runtime/)

-   How to Customize Your Network

    Once your base network is set up, you can start customizing it to suit your specific needs:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Leverage preexisting modules to add functionality](/builders/build/customize/adding-built-in-module/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Create your own custom module](/builders/build/customize/adding-custom-made-module/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Integrate external modules from other providers](/builders/build/customize/adding-external-module/)

-   Ready to Deploy?

    After customizing and testing your network, itâ€™s time to deploy:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Deploy your network with the Tanssi dApp](/builders/deploy/dapp/)

-   Steps to Take After Deployment

    Once your Tanssi-powered network is live, follow these steps to ensure smooth and ongoing operations:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Pay for block production services](/builders/manage/dapp/services-payment/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Mint tokens for your network's economy](/builders/manage/dapp/manage-tokens/)
    
    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Manage the Sudo account for administrative control](/builders/manage/developer-portal/sudo/)

-   Tanssi Network Information

    Get the essential network details and access points for integrating your app with a Tanssi-powered network:

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Access network endpoints for integration](/builders/tanssi-network/endpoints/)

-   Tools for Tanssi Network Development

    Use the right tools to interact with and create applications on Tanssi networks

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Explore tools for Ethereum API integration](/builders/toolkit/ethereum-api/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Leverage Substrate tools for advanced network control](/builders/toolkit/substrate-api/)

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Enhance functionality of your app with integrations](/builders/toolkit/integrations/)
