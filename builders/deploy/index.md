# Deploy Your Appchain in Minutes

With Tanssi, launching your appchain is straightforward and efficient. The platform simplifies the process, so you can focus on building your application.

## Quick Overview of Deploying via the Tanssi DApp

Deploying a Tanssi-powered appchain via the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank} is accomplished as a single, streamlined flow consisting of five distinct steps:

1. Select a [template](/builders/build/templates/overview/){target=\_blank} and configure it
2. Satisfy the required minimum token balances
3. Reserve your Tanssi appchain ID
4. Generate your custom appchain files
5. Register your appchain on Tanssi

!!! note
    For _Quick Trial appchains_ and _Dedicated appchains_ on the [Tanssi TestNet](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancelight/){target=\_blank}, the Tanssi team will manually complete verification. After verification, it typically takes about ten minutes for your quick trial appchain to be ready and about two hours for a dedicated one. For Tanssi MainNet, the process will be fully decentralized and permissionless.
