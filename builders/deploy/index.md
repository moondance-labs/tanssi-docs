# Deploy Your Appchain in Minutes

With Tanssi, launching your appchain is straightforward and efficient. The platform simplifies the process, so you can focus on building your application.

## Quick Overview of Deploying via the Tanssi DApp

Deploying a Tanssi-powered network via the [Tanssi dApp](https://apps.tanssi.network){target=\_blank} is accomplished as a single, streamlined flow consisting of five distinct steps:

1. Select a [template](/builders/build/templates/overview/){target=\_blank} and configure it
2. Satisfy the required minimum token balances
3. Reserve your Tanssi network ID on the relay chain
4. Generate your custom network files
5. Register your network on Tanssi, and the relay chain

!!! note
    For [Snap networks and Dedicated networks](/builders/deploy/dapp/##snap-appchains-vs-dedicated-appchains) on the [Tanssi Dancebox Testnet](/builders/tanssi-network/testnet/dancebox/){target=\_blank}, the Tanssi team will manually complete verification. After verification, it typically takes about ten minutes for your Snap appchain to be ready and about two hours for a dedicated Tanssi appchain. For Tanssi MainNet, the process will be fully decentralized and permissionless.
