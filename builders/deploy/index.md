# Deploy Your Appchain in 5 steps

With Tanssi, launching your appchain is straightforward and efficient. Our platform simplifies the process, so you can focus on building your application.

### **How Deploy Using The Tannssi DApp**

The Tanssi dApp is an intuitive tool that guides you through every stage of appchain deployment. From selecting templates to finalizing configurations, the Tanssi dApp makes it easy.

**Just follow these simple steps:**

1. **Select and Configure Your Template:** Select the appropriate template (EVM or Substrate) for your appchain and configure the basic settings, including project name, token symbol, and chain ID.
2. **Meet Minimum Balance Requirements:** Verify that your wallet holds the required minimum balance of 100 Snap tokens and 70 Unit tokens to proceed with the deployment.(If you don't have enough balance, you can get it from in the dApp).
3. **Reserve Your Appchain ID:** Secure a unique appchain ID on the relay chain to ensure your appchain is recognized and avoid ID conflicts.
4. **Generate Appchain Files:** Automatically create the runtime and configuration files needed to finalize your appchain setup.
5. **Register Your Appchain:** Complete the deployment by registering your appchain on both the Tanssi network and the relay chain, making it active and operational.

!!! tip "Snap Appchains vs. Dedicated Appchains"
    - **Snap Appchains**: A temporary appchain that self-destructs after 48 hours. Ideal for testing the power and features of a Tanssi-created appchain. Snap appchains can go live within **10 minutes**.
    - **Dedicated Appchains**: A long-lasting appchain designed for production environments and ecosystem builders. Dedicated appchains can take up to **2 hours** to go live.
     
    Use Snap Appchains for quick experimentation, and choose Dedicated Appchains for more permanent solutions.
